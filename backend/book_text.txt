Praise for The Art of Learning
“We all remember the portrayal of Josh Waitzkin in Searching for Bobby
Fischer. He was a very impressive child who continues to impress with The
Art of Learning. Through a unique set of experiences, Waitzkin has formed an
original and outstanding perspective. From chess to Tai Chi, he provides tools
that allow all of us to improve ourselves every day.”
—Cal Ripken, Jr., 2007 B aseball Hall of Fame Induc tee
“Waitzkin’s engaging voice and his openness . . . make him a welcome
teacher.”
—Publishers Weekly
“A vibrant and engaging look at the love of learning and the pursuit of
excellence.”
—Booklist
“The Art of Learning succeeds on every level, by combining a truly compelling
autobiography with profound philosophical and psychological insights, all
wrapped in a practical how-to framework. This is a must-read for anyone
wishing to achieve that rare combination of success and fulﬁllment.”
—Paul Blease, SVP, Director Team Development & Consulting, C itigroup
Smith Barney
“Waitzkin’s in-depth look into the mental side of his success in both chess
and martial arts is an inspiring and absorbing read. I strongly recommend it
for anyone who lives in a world of competition, whether it’s sports or business
or anywhere else. It’s also a great training tool for kids aspiring to reach the
pinnacle of their chosen ﬁelds.”
—Mark Messier, 6-time Stanley Cup Champion

About the AuthorFor my mom, my hero, Bonnie WaitzkinINTRODUCTION
One has to investigate the principle in one thing or one event exhaustively . . . Things and
the self are governed by the same principle. If you understand one, you understand the other,
for the truth within and the truth without are identical.

Finals: Tai Chi Chuan Push Hands World Championships Hsinchuang Stadium, Taipei,
Taiwan December 5, 2004
Forty seconds before round two, and I’m lying on my back trying to breathe. Pain all
through me. Deep breath. Let it go. I won’t be able to lift my shoulder tomorrow, it
won’t heal for over a year, but now it pulses, alive, and I feel the air vibrating around
me, the stadium shaking with chants, in Mandarin, not for me. My teammates are
kneeling above me, looking worried. They rub my arms, my shoulders, my legs. The
bell rings. I hear my dad’s voice in the stands, ‘C’mon Josh!’ Gotta get up. I watch my
opponent run to the center of the ring. He screams, pounds his chest. The fans explode.
They call him Buffalo. Bigger than me, stronger, quick as a cat. But I can take him
—if I make it to the middle of the ring without falling over. I have to dig deep, bring
it up from somewhere right now. Our wrists touch, the bell rings, and he hits me like a
Mack truck.
Who  could have guessed it would come to this? Just a few years earlier I
had been competing around the world in elite chess tournaments. Since I was
eight years old, I had consistently been the highest rated player for my age in
the United States, and my life was dominated by competitions and training
regimens designed to bring me into peak form for the next national or world
championship. I had spent the years between ages ﬁfteen and eighteen in the
maelstrom of American media following the release of the ﬁlm Searching for
Bobby Fischer, which was based on my dad’s book about my early chess life. I
was known as America’s great young chess player and was told that it was mydestiny to follow in the footsteps of immortals like Bobby Fischer and Garry
Kasparov, to be world champion.
But there were problems. After the movie came out I couldn’t go to a
tournament without being surrounde d by fans asking for autographs. Instead
of focusing on chess positions, I was pulled into the image of myself as a
celebrity. Since childhood I had treasured the sublime study of chess, the
swim through ever-deepening layers of complexity. I could spend hours at a
chessboard and stand up from the experience on ﬁre with insight about chess,
basketball, the ocean, psychology, love, art. The game was exhilarating and
also spiritually calming. It centered me. Chess was my friend. Then,
sudde nly, the game became alien and di squieting.
I recall one tournament in Las Vegas: I was a young International Master
in a ﬁeld of a thousand competitors including twenty-six strong
Grandmasters from around the world. As an up-and-coming player, I had
huge  respect for the great sages around me. I had studied their masterpieces
for hund reds of hours and was awed by the artistry of these men. Before ﬁrst-
round play began I was seated at my board, deep in thought about my
opening preparation, when the public address system announced that the
subject of Searching for Bobby Fischer was at the event. A tournament director
placed a poster of the movie next to my table, and immediately a sea of fans
surged around the ropes separating the top boards from the audience. As the
games progressed, when I rose to clear my mind young girls gave me their
phone num bers and asked me to autograph their stomachs or legs.
This might sound like a dream for a seventeen-year-old boy, and I won’t
deny enjoying the attention, but professionally it was a nightmare. My game
began to unravel. I caught myself thinking about how I looked thinking
instead of losing myself in thought. The Grandmasters, my elders, were
ignored and scowled at me. Some of them treated me like a pariah. I had won
eight national championships and had more fans, public suppo rt and
recognition than I could dream of, but none of this was helping my search for
excellence, let alone for happiness.
At a young age I came to know that there is something profoundly hollow
about the nature of fame. I had spent my life devoted to artistic growth and
was used to the sweaty-palmed sense of contentment one gets after many
hours of intense reﬂection. This peaceful feeling had nothing to do with
external adulation, and I yearned for a return to that innocent, fertile time. Imissed just being a student of the game, but there was no escaping the
spotlight. I found myself dreading chess, miserable before leaving for
tournaments. I played without inspiration and was invited to appear on
television shows. I smiled.
Then when I was eighteen years old I stumbled upon a little book called
the Tao Te Ching, and my life took a turn. I was moved by the book’s natural
wisdom and I started delving into other Buddhi st and Taoist philosophical
texts. I recognized that being at the pinnacle in other people’s eyes had
nothing to do with quality of life, and I was drawn to the potential for inner
tranquility.
On October 5, 1998, I walked into William C. C. Chen’s Tai Chi Chuan
studio in downtown Manhattan and found myself surrounde d by peacefully
concentrating men and women ﬂoating through a choreographed set of
movements. I was used to driven chess players cultivating tunne l vision in
order to win the big game, but now the focus was on bodily awareness, as if
there were some inner bliss that resulted from mindfully moving slowly in
strange ways.
I began taking classes and after a few weeks I found myself practicing the
meditative movements for hours at home. Given the complicated nature of
my chess life, it was beautifully liberating to be learning in an environment
in which I was simply one of the beginners—and something felt right about
this art. I was amazed by the way my body pulsed with life when ﬂowing
through t he ancient steps, as if I were tapping into a primal alignment.
My teacher, the world-renowned Grandmaster William C. C. Chen, spent
months with me in beginner classes, patiently correcting my movements. In
a room with ﬁfteen new students, Chen would look into my eyes from twenty
feet away, quietly assume my posture, and relax his elbow a half inch one way
or another. I would follow his subtle instruction and sudde nly my hand w ould
come alive with throbbing energy as if he had plugge d me into a soothing
electrical current. His insight into body mechanics seemed magical, but
perhaps equally impressive was Chen’s humility. Here was a man thought by
many to be the greatest living Tai Chi Master in the world, and he patiently
taught ﬁrst-day novices with the same loving attention he gave his senior
students.
I learned quickly, and became fascinated with the growth that I was
experiencing. Since I was twelve years old I had kept journals of my chessstudy, making psychological observations along the way—no w I was doing
the same with Tai Chi.
After about six months of reﬁning my form (the choreographed
movements that are the heart of Tai Chi Chuan), Master Chen invited me to
join the Push Hands class. This was very exciting, my baby steps toward the
martial side of the art. In my ﬁrst session, my teacher and I stood facing each
other, each of us with our right leg forward and the backs of our right wrists
touching. He told me to push into him, but when I did he wasn’t there
anymore. I felt sucked forward, as if by a vacuum. I stumbled and scratched
my head. Next, he gently pushed into me and I tried to get out of the way
but didn’t know where to go. Finally I fell back on old instincts, tried to
resist the incoming force, and with barely any contact Chen sent me ﬂying
into the air.
Over time, Master Chen taught me the body mechanics of nonresistance.
As my training became more vigorous, I learned to dissolve away from
attacks while staying rooted to the ground. I found myself calculating less
and feeling more, and as I internalized the physical techniques all the little
movements of the Tai Chi meditative form started to come alive to me in
Push Hands practice. I remember one time, in the middle of a sparring
session I sensed a hole in my partner’s structure and sudde nly he seemed to
leap away from me. He looked shocked and told me that he had been pushed
away, but he hadn’t noticed any explosive movement on my part. I had no
idea what to make of this, but slowly I began to realize the martial power of
my living room meditation sessions. After thousands of slow-motion, ever-
reﬁned repetitions of certain movements, my body could become that shape
instinctively. Somehow in Tai Chi the mind needed little physical action to
have great physical effect.
This type of learning experience was familiar to me from chess. My whole
life I had studied techniques, principles, and theory until they were
integrated into the unconscious. From the outside Tai Chi and chess couldn’t
be more different, but they began to converge in my mind. I started to
translate my chess ideas into Tai Chi langua ge, as if the two arts were linked
by an essential connecting ground. Every day I noticed more and more
similarities, until I began to feel as if I were studying chess when I was
studying Tai Chi. Once I was giving a forty-board simultaneous chess
exhibition in Memphis and I realized halfway through that I had beenplaying all the games as Tai Chi. I wasn’t calculating with chess notation or
thinking about opening variations . . . I was feeling ﬂow, ﬁlling space left
behind, riding waves like I do at sea or in martial arts. This was wild! I was
winning chess games without playing chess.
Similarly, I would be in a Push Hands competition and time would seem
to slow down enough to allow me to methodically take apart my opponent’s
structure and uncover his vulnerability, as in a chess game. My fascination
with consciousness, study of chess and Tai Chi, love for literature and the
ocean, for meditation and philosophy, all coalesced around the theme of
tapping into the mind’s potential via complete immersion into one and all
activities. My growth became deﬁned by barrierlessness. Pure concentration
didn’t allow thoughts or false constructions to impede my awareness, and I
observed clear connections between different life experiences through the
common mode of consciousness by which they were perceived.
As I cultivated openness to these connections, my life became ﬂooded with
intense learning experiences. I remember sitting on a Bermuda cliff one
stormy afternoon, watching waves pound into the rocks. I was focused on the
water trickling back out to sea and sudde nly knew the answer to a chess
problem I had been wrestling with for weeks. Another time, after completely
immersing myself in the analysis of a chess position for eight hours, I had a
breakthrough in my Tai Chi and successfully tested it in class that night.
Great literature inspired chess growth, shooting jump shots on a New York
City blacktop gave me insight about ﬂuidity that applied to Tai Chi,
becoming at peace holding my breath seventy feet unde rwater as a free-diver
helped me in the time pressure of world championship chess or martial arts
competitions. Training in the ability to quickly lower my heart rate after
intense physical strain helped me recover between periods of exhausting
concentration in chess tournaments. After several years of cloudiness, I was
ﬂying free, devouring information, completely in love with learning.
*  *  *
Before I began to conceive of this book, I was content to understand my
growth in the martial arts in a very abstract manner. I related to my
experience with langua ge like parallel learning and translation of level. I felt as
though I had transferred the essence of my chess unde rstanding into my TaiChi practice. But this didn’t make much sense, especially outside of my own
head. What does essence really mean anyway? And how does one transfer it
from a mental to a physical discipline?
These questions became the central preoccupation in my life after I won
my ﬁrst Push Hands National Championship in November 2000. A t the time
I was studying philosophy at Columbia University and was especially drawn
to Asian thought. I discovered some interesting founda tions for my
experience in ancient Indian, Chinese, Tibetan, and Greek texts—
Upanishadic essence, Taoist receptivity, Neo-Confucian principle, Buddhi st
nonduality, and the Platonic forms all seemed to be a bizarre cross-cultural
trace of what I was searching for. Whe never I had an idea, I would test it
against some brilliant professor who usually disagreed with my conclusions.
Academic minds tend to be impatient with abstract langua ge—when I spoke
about intuition, one philosophy professor rolled her eyes and told me the term
had no meaning. The need for precision forced me to think about these ideas
more concretely. I had to come to a deeper sense of concepts like essence,
quality, principle, intuition, and wisdom in order to unde rstand my own
experience, let alone have any chance of communicating it.
As I struggled for a more precise grasp of my own learning process, I was
forced to retrace my steps and remember what had been internalized and
forgotten. In both my chess and martial arts lives, there is a method of study
that has been critical to my growth. I sometimes refer to it as the study of
numbers to leave numbers, or form to leave form. A basic example of this process,
which applies to any discipline, can easily be illustrated through chess: A
chess student must initially become immersed in the funda mentals in order
to have any potential to reach a high level of skill. He or she will learn the
principles of endga me, middlegame, and opening play. Initially one or two
critical themes will be considered at once, but over time the intuition learns
to integrate more and more principles into a sense of ﬂow. Eventually the
founda tion is so deeply internalized that it is no longer consciously
considered, but is lived. This process continuously cycles along as deeper
layers of the art are soaked in.
Very strong chess players will rarely speak of the funda mentals, but these
beacons are the building blocks of their mastery. Similarly, a great pianist or
violinist does not think about individual notes, but hits them all perfectly in
a virtuoso performance. In fact, thinking about a “C” while playingBeethoven’s 5th Symphony could be a real hitch because the ﬂow might be
lost. The problem is that if you want to write an instructional chess book for
beginners, you have to dig up all the stuff that is buried in your unconscious
—I had this issue when I wrote my ﬁrst book, Attacking Chess. In order to
write for beginners, I had to break down my chess knowledge incrementally,
whereas for years I had been cultivating a seamless integration of the critical
information.
The same pattern can be seen when the art of learning is analyzed: themes
can be internalized, lived by, and forgotten. I ﬁgured out how to learn
efﬁciently in the brutally competitive world of chess, where a moment
without growth spells a front-row seat to rivals mercilessly passing you by.
Then I intuitively applied my hard-earned lessons to the martial arts. I
avoided the pitfalls and tempting divergences that a learner is confronted
with, but I didn’t really think about them because the road map was deep
inside me—just like the chess principles.
Since I decided to write this book, I have analyzed myself, taken my
knowledge apart, and rigorously investigated my own experience. Speaking to
corporate and academic audiences about my learning experience has also
challenged me to make my ideas more accessible. Whe never there was a
concept or learning technique that I related to in a manner too abstract to
convey, I forced myself to break it down into the incremental steps with
which I got there. Over time I began to see the principles that have been
silently guiding m e, and a systematic methodology of learning emerged.
My chess life began in Washington Square Park in New York’s Greenwich
Village, and took me on a sixteen-year-roller-coaster ride, through world
championships in America, Romania, Germany, Hunga ry, Brazil, and India,
through every kind of heartache and ecstasy a competitor can imagine. In
recent years, my Tai Chi life has become a dance of meditation and intense
martial competition, of pure growth and the observation, testing, and
exploration of that learning process. I have currently won thirteen Tai Chi
Chuan Push Hands National Championship titles, placed third in the 2002
World Championship in Taiwan, and in 2004 I won the Chung Hwa Cup
International in Taiwan, the World Championship of Tai Chi Chuan Push
Hands.
A lifetime of competition has not cooled my ardor to win, but I have
grown to love the study and training above all else. After so many years of biggames, performing unde r pressure has become a way of life. Presence unde r
ﬁre hardly feels different from the presence I feel sitting at my computer,
typing these sentences. Wha t I have realized is that what I am best at is not
Tai Chi, and it is not chess—what I am best at is the art of learning. This
book is the story of my method.

THE FOUNDATION
CHAPTER 1
INNOCENT MOVES
I remember the cold late winter afternoon in downtown New York City, my
mother and I holding hands while walking to the playground in Washington
Square Park. I was six years old, a rough-and-tumble kid with a passion for
Spider-Man, sharks, dinosaurs, sports, and driving my parents crazy with
mischief. “Too much boy,” my mom says. I constantly pestered my dad to
throw around a football or baseball or to wrestle in the living room. My
friends called me “waste skin” because my knees were often raw from taking
spills in the playground or diving for catches. I had an early attraction to the
edge, using scraps of wood and cinder blocks from a construction site next
door to set up makeshift jump courses for my bike. I refused to wear a helmet
until one gorgeous twist ended with a face plant and my mom vowed to no
longer wear her headgear when horseback riding unl ess I followed suit.
We had taken this walk dozens of times. I loved to swing around on the
monkey bars and become Tarzan, the world my jungle. But now something
felt different. I looked over my shoulder, and was transﬁxed by mysterious
ﬁgurines set up on a marble chessboard. I remember feeling like I was
looking into a forest. The pieces were animals, ﬁlled with strange potential,
as if something dangerous and magical were about to leap from the board.
Two park hustlers sat across the table taunting each other. The air was thick
with tension, and then the pieces exploded into action, nimble ﬁnge rs
moving with lightning speed and precision, white and black ﬁgures darting
all over the board, creating patterns. I was pulled into the battleﬁeld,
enraptured; something felt familiar about this game, it made sense. Then a
crowd gathered around the table and I couldn’t see anymore. My mom called
me, gently pulled on my hand, a nd w e moved on to the playground.A few days later my mom and I were walking through the same corner of
the park when I broke away from her and ran up to an old man with a grey
beard who was setting up plastic pieces on one of the marble boards. That day
I had watched a couple of kids playing chess at school and I thought I could
do it—“Wanna play?” The old man looked at me suspiciously over his
spectacles. My mom apologized, explained that I didn’t know how to play
chess, but the old man said that it was okay, he had children, and he had a
little time to kill. My mom tells me that when the game began my tongue
was out and resting on my uppe r lip, a sure sign I was either stuffed up or
concentrating. I remember the strange sensation of discovering a lost
memory. As we moved the pieces, I felt like I had done this before. There was
a harmony to this game, like a good song. The old man read a newspaper
while I thought about my moves, but after a few minutes he got angry and
snapped at my mom, accused her of hustling him. Apparently I was playing
well.
I had generated an attack by coordinating a few of my pieces and the old
man had to buckle down to ﬁght it off. After a little while a crowd gathered
around t he board—pe ople were whispering something about “Young Fi scher.”
My mom was confused, a little concerned about what had come over her boy.
I was in my own world. Eventually the old man won the game. We shook
hands and he  asked me my name. He wrote it on his newspaper and said “Josh
Waitzkin, I’m gonna read about you in the paper someday.”
From that day forward, Washington Square Park became a second home to
me. And chess became my ﬁrst love. After school, instead of hungering for
soccer or baseball, I insisted on heading to the park. I’d plop down against
some scary-looking dude , put my game face on, and go to war. I loved the
thrill of battle, and some days I would play countless speed chess games, hour
after hour staring through the jungle of pieces, ﬁguring things out, throwing
mental grenades back and forth in a sweat. I would go home with chess pieces
ﬂying through my mind, and then I would ask my dad to take down his dusty
wooden set and pl ay with me.
Over time, as I became a trusted part of the park scene, the guys took me
unde r their wings, showed me their tricks, taught me how to generate
devastating attacks and get into the head of my opponent. I became a protégé
of the street, hard to rattle, a feisty competitor. It was a bizarre school for a
child, a rough crowd of alcoholics, homeless geniuses, wealthy gamblershooked on the game, junkies, eccentric artists—all diamonds in the rough,
brilliant, beat men, lives in shambles, aﬂame with a passion for chess.
Every day, unless it poured or snowed, the nineteen marble tables in the
southwest corner of Washington Square would ﬁll up with this motley crew.
And most days I was there, knocking chessmen over with my short arms,
chewing gum, learning the game. Of course my parents thought long and
hard before allowing me to hang out in the park, but I was adamant and the
guys cleaned up their acts when I came to play. The cigarettes and joints were
put out, the language was cleaned up, few deals went down. I would sit across
from one of my buddi es, immediately sweating and focused. My mom told
me she saw her little boy become an old man when I played chess. I
concentrated so hard, she thought her hand would burn if she put it in front
of my eyes. It is difﬁcult for me to explain the seriousness I had about chess
as a young boy. I guess it was a calling, though I’m still not sure what that
means.
After a few months I could already beat a number of the guys who had
been playing for decades. Whe n I lost a game, one of my friends would give
me a piece of advice—“Josh, you laid back too long, he got comfortable, you
gotta go after ’em, make ’em scared” or “Josh, my man, sometimes you gotta
castle, get your king to safety, check yourself before you wreck yourself.”
Then I would hit the clock, buckle down, and try again. Each loss was a
lesson, each win a thrill. Every day pieces of the puzzle fell together.
Whe never I showed up to play, big crowds would gather around the table.
I was a star in this little world, and while all the attention was exciting for a
child, it was also a challenge. I learned quickly that when I thought about the
people watching, I played badly. It was hard for a six-year-old ham to ignore
throngs of adults talking about him, but when well focused, I seemed to
hover in an in-between state where the intensity of the chess position mixed
with the rumble of voices, trafﬁc noises, ambulance sirens, all in an inspiring
swirl that fueled my mind. Some days I could concentrate more purely in the
chaos of Washington Square than in the quiet of my family’s living room.
Other days I would look around at everybody, get caught up in their
conversations, and play terribly. I’m sure it was frustrating for my parents
watching my early discovery of chess—there was no telling whether I’d chew
gummy bears, smile, joke, and hang my pieces or buckle down into another
world of intensity.One Saturday afternoon there was a tall ﬁgure standing in the crowd while
I played speed chess against my friend Jerry. I noticed him, but then fell back
into the game. A couple of hours later the man approached my father and
introduced himself as Bruce Pandolﬁni, a master-level player and a chess
teacher. Bruce told my dad I was very gifted, and offered to teach me.
It turns out that my father recognized Bruce as the man who did television
commentary with Shelby Lyman during the historic Bobby Fischer vs. Boris
Spassky World Championship match in 1972. The match had revolutionized
chess—it was a cold-war face-off pitting the Soviet World Champion along
with his team of one hundr ed coaches and trainers against the brash renegade
American challenger who did all his preparation alone in a room without a
view. Fischer was a combination of James Dean and Greta Garbo and America
was fascinated.
There were huge  political implications to this contest of great thinkers.
Increasingly, as the match unfolded, it became perceived as the embodiment
of the cold war. Henry Kissinger called Bobby with suppo rt; politicians on
both sides followed each game closely. The world watched breathless as
Shelby and Bruce brought chess to life on television with their human, down-
home analysis of the games. When Fischer won the match, he became an
international celebrity and chess exploded across America. Sudde nly the game
stood shoulder to shoulder with basketball, football, baseball, hockey. Then in
1975 Fischer disappeared instead of defending his title. Chess in America
receded into the shadows. Ever since the American chess world has been
searching for a new Bobby Fischer, someone to bring the sport back into the
limelight.
Shelby and Bruce had captured my dad’s imagination twenty years before,
and now it was a bit surreal that Bruce was offering to teach his six-year-old
bowling ball of a child. I was nonplussed. Chess was fun, and the guys in the
park were my buddies. They were teaching me ﬁne. Why  should I have any
more coaches? I was private about chess, as if it were an intimate fantasy
world. I had to trust someone to let them into my thought process, and Bruce
had to overcome this shield before the work could begin.
Our ﬁrst lessons were anything but orthodox. We hardly “studied chess.”
Bruce knew it was more important for us to get to know one another, to
establish a genuine camaraderie. So we talked about life, sports, dinosaurs,things that interested me. Whe never the discussion turned to chess, I was
stubbo rn about my ideas and refused to receive formal instruction.
I insisted on some bad habits I had learned in the park—for example,
bringing out my queen early. This is a typical beginner’s error: the queen is
the most powerful piece on the chessboard so people want to bring her into
the action right away. Against unskilled opponents who can’t parry simple
attacks, this strategy works marvelously. The problem is that since the queen
cannot be traded for any of the opponent’s pieces without signiﬁcant loss, she
can be chased all over the board while the other guy naturally brings his less
valuable but quite potent warriors into play and simultaneously swats aside
the primitive threats of the lone queen. Lo gical enough, but  I resisted because
I had won so many early games with a wandering queen. Bruce couldn’t
convince me with words—he  had to prove it.
Bruce decided we should have knock-down drag-out speed chess matches
like the ones I was used to in the park. Whe never I made a funda mental error,
he would mention the principle I had violated. If I refused to budge , he’d
proceed to take advantage of the error until my position fell apart. Over time,
Bruce earned my respect as I saw the correctness of his ideas. My queen
started to wait until the moment was right. I learned to develop my pieces, to
control the center, to prepare attacks systematically.
Once he had won my trust, Bruce taught me by allowing me to express
myself. The main obstacle to overcome was my impetuosity. I was a talented
kid with good instincts who had been beating up on street hustlers who
lacked classical training. Now it was time to slow me down and properly arm
my intuition, but Bruce had a ﬁne line to tread. He had to teach me to be
more disciplined without dampening my love for chess or suppressing my
natural voice. Many teachers have no feel for this balance and try to force
their students into cookie-cutter molds. I have run into quite a few
egomaniacal instructors like this over the years and have come to believe that
their method is profoundly destructive for students in the long run—i n any
case, it certainly would not have worked with me.
I’m sure I was a tough kid to teach. My parents raised a willful child. Even
as a young boy I was encouraged to take part in the spirited dinner party
debates about art and politics in my family’s living room. I was taught to
express my opinion and to think about the ideas of others—no t to follow
authority blindly. Fortunately, Bruce’s educational philosophy ﬁt mycharacter perfectly. He didn’t present himself as omniscient, and he handled
himself as more of a guide in my development than as an authority. If I
disagreed with him, we would have a discussion, no t a lecture.
Bruce slowed me down by asking questions. Whe never I made an
important decision, good or bad, he would ask me to explain my thought
process. Were there other ways to accomplish the same aim? Had I looked for
my opponent’s threats? Did I consider a different order of operations? Bruce
didn’t patronize me—some teachers rebel so far away from being
authoritarian that they praise all their little player’s decisions, good or bad.
Their intention is to build conﬁde nce, but instead they discourage
objectivity, encourage self-indulgence, and perhaps most destructively, they
create a dishonest relationship between instructor and pupil that any bright
child can sense.
Whe n I made a bad move, Bruce asked me what my idea was and then
helped me discover how I could have approached the decision-making process
differently. Much of the time in our lessons was spent in silence, with us both
thinking. Bruce did not want to feed me information, but to help my mind
carve itself into maturity. Over time, in his coaxing, humorous, and
unde rstatedly ﬁrm manner, Bruce gave me a founda tion of critical chess
principles and a systematic unde rstanding of analysis and calculation. While
the new knowledge was valuable, the most important factor in these ﬁrst
months of study was that Bruce nurtured my love for chess, and he never let
technical material smother my innate feeling for the game.
During these early months of work with Bruce, we would meet once or
twice a week in my family’s apartment—sometimes early mornings,
sometimes after school. Most other days, I would go to Washington Square
and duke  it out with my friends in the park. As a six- and seven-year-old boy
I had two powerful currents to my chess education, and the key was to make
them coexist peacefully—the street-tough competitor had to fuse with the
classically trained, patient player that Bruce was inspiring. Though when
very young I was periodically reluctant about real chess work, I loved the
sublime beauty of old World Championship games I studied with Bruce—
sometimes sitting in silence and calculating an endga me position for twenty
minutes would thrill me to the core. But other times such serious thinking
would bore me and I’d hunge r to play speed chess with my buddi es, to attack,to be a little reckless and create beautiful combinations. The park was fun. I
was a child after all.
Despite signiﬁcant outside pressure, my parents and Bruce decided to keep
me out of tournaments until I had been playing chess for a year or so, because
they wanted my relationship to the game to be about learning and passion
ﬁrst, and competition a distant second. My mother and Bruce were
particularly ambivalent about exposing me to the harsh pressures of
competitive chess—they gave me some extra months of innocence for which I
am grateful. Whe n I ﬁnally started playing in scholastic tournaments, soon
after my seventh birthday, the games felt easy. Children my own age didn’t
fashion complicated attacks and defenses like the guys in the park did, and
they would crumble unde r pressure. Some of the kids were armed with
dangerous opening traps, memorized variations that could lead to early
advantages, so I often came out of the opening do wn a pawn or two—but  then
they didn’t have a chance. For me, competitive chess was not about
perfection. It was more of a mental prizeﬁght, with two opponents trading
advantages, momentum going one way and then the other. My friends in
Washington Square were valiant competitors, you could never count them
out—in fact they were most dangerous when on the ropes. Many very
talented kids expected to win without much resistance. Whe n the game was a
struggle, they were emotionally unpr epared.
I thrived unde r adversity. My style was to make the game complex and
then work my way through the chaos. Whe n the position was wild, I had
huge  conﬁdence. Bruce and I also spent a lot of time studying endga mes,
where the board is nearly empty and high-level principles combine with deep
calculations to create fascinating battles. While my opponents wanted to win
in the openings, right off the bat, I guided positions into complicated
middlegames and abstract endings. So as the game went on, their conﬁde nce
shrank and I became a predator. Noticing these tendencies, Bruce started
calling m e “Tiger.” He still calls me Tiger today.
My ﬁrst year of competitive chess was smooth sailing. I felt unbe atable
when matched up with kids my age, and the combination of street toughne ss
and classical education proved devastating for my opponents. Perhaps the
most decisive element of my game was the way my style on the board was
completely in synch with my personality as a child. I was unhindered by
internal conﬂict—a state of being that I have come to see as funda mental tothe learning process. Bruce and the park guys had taught me how to express
myself through c hess, and so my love for the game grew every day.
As the months went by, I piled up win after win and my national rating
skyrocketed. I’d show up at a tournament and kids were terriﬁed of me, which
felt strange. I was, after all, a young child who was scared of the dark and
loved Scooby-Doo. More than once, opponents started weeping at the board
before the game had even begun. I felt bad for them but also empowered.
Before I knew it I was the highest-ranked player for my age in the country.
The next step was the National Championship, to be held in Charlotte, North
Carolina. The guys in the park were buzzing with excitement, showing me
more and more weapons, honing my game. I was the hands-down favorite to
win the primary division (kindergarten through 3rd grade). There wasn’t a
doubt in my mind.CHAPTER 2
LOSING TO WIN
Primary School National Chess Championship Charlotte, North Carolina May 5, 1985.
Last round. Board one. Winner takes the title. My opponent and I were set up
on a solitary table in front of an unmanned camera that would relay the
position to press, coaches, and anxiety-ridden parents in the hotel lobby. The
rest of the competitors, over ﬁve hundr ed of the country’s top young chess
players who had come to battle for the National Championships, faced off on
long rows of chessboards ﬁlling up the rest of the tense playing hall. The top
board is a throne or a prison, depending on how you look at it. Everyone
dreams of getting there, but then you arrive and ﬁnd yourself all alone,
trapped on a pedestal with a bull’s-eye on your forehead. Entering the
tournament, I was the man to beat. I knew teams had been gunn ing for me,
spending months of preparation on treacherous opening traps designed
speciﬁcally to catch me off guard. But I had already rolled over my ﬁrst six
opponents, giving up only one draw. I felt unbe atable when matched up
against kids my age. They couldn’t touch me.
Little did I know that my opponent was a well-armed genius. His name
was David Arnett. At three years old he had memorized the New York City
subway map. At ﬁve he was doing high school math. At six he was the top
ﬁrst-grader in the country and the best chess player at the prestigious Dalton
School, which was coached by Svetozar Jovanovic, a legend in scholastic chess
who had taught many young champions. Jovanovic had given David a
classical chess education and a sense for competitive discipline to rival my
own. Soon after this game, Dave and I would become best friends. But right
now he was just a buck-toothed little blond ki d who looked petriﬁed.On the third move of the game, David made a strange decision, allowing
me to capture his king pawn with my knight. I should have taken some time
to look for traps, but I moved too quickly. Then he was all over me, bringing
his queen into a dangerous attacking position, chasing my overextended
knight who had nowhere safe to hide. I’d been stupid to grab the pawn. Now
this smart little kid was going after my king and I was ﬁght ing for my life.
I can see my eight-year-old self as the game slipped away, sitting at the
board, sweat beginning to ﬂow, goose bumps rising, my heart picking up
speed, hungry stares of envious rivals sitting at nearby chessboards, the eerie
rustling silence of the playing hall, the fragility of so many dreams. I wasn’t a
superman. I was a child who slept in my parents’ bedroom because of terrible
nightmares, now competing with the world on my shoulders and everything
falling apart.
I had a choice of completely self-destructing or losing some material,
regrouping, and then trying to ﬁght back. I’d done this countless times at
Washington Square Park. But being on the ropes against a kid was new to
me. I had dealt with the pressures of being the favorite at the Nationals by
pufﬁng myself up with a sense of invincibility. Conﬁde nce is critical for a
great competitor, but overconﬁde nce is brittle. We are too smart for ourselves
in such moments. We sense our mortality like a cancer beneath the bravado,
and when things start to go out of control, there is little real resilience to fall
back on.
Whe n the game was over I was stunne d, reeling from being so close to
winning my ﬁrst national championship and then letting it go, self-
destructing, falling apart. Was I a loser? Had I let my parents down? Wha t
about the guys in the park, Bruce, my friends at school? How could I have
lost? One of the problems with being too high is that there is a long way to
fall. Had I fallen in my own eyes or also in the eyes of those around me? After
trying so hard, was there worth outside of winning? An eight-year-old is
hardly prepared to deal with such loaded issues, and I was very fortunate to
have a family with the ability to keep, or at least regain, a bit of perspective
in times of extreme intensity. We went ﬁshing.
*  *  *The ocean has been a huge  part of my life since the womb. Literally. Whe n
my mother was ﬁve months pregnant, we were at sea, trolling for blue marlin
in ten-foot Gulf Stream rollers. Some of my earliest memories are from the
dock of my family’s little house on mosquito-ridden South Bimini Island,
ﬁshing for snappers, feeding moray eels, swatting away bugs at night while
chumming for sharks.
Growing up, I knew that come summertime, we would head off to sea no
matter what else was happening in our lives, what crisis was looming, what
tournaments I was missing, how out of context or absurd our ocean trips
might have felt at the moment of departure. I have come to unde rstand that
these little breaks from the competitive intensity of my life have been and
still are an integral part of my success. Times at sea are periods of renewal,
coming together with family, being with nature, putting things back in
perspective. I am able to let my conscious mind move away from my
training, and to gain creative new angles on the next steps of my growth.
These trips are a far cry from luxurious vacations—actually they are nonstop
manual labor, sweating in the engine room trying to coax an old generator
back to life, working the cockpit in the hot sun, keeping the boat together in
angry squalls, navigating through bi g seas, living right on the edge.
The boating life has also been a wonderful training ground for
performance psychology. Living on the water requires constant presence, and
the release of control. A boat is always moving with the sea, lurching beneath
your feet, and the only way to survive is to sink into rhythm with the waves
and be ready for anything. I learned at sea that virtually all situations can be
handled as long as presence of mind is maintained. On the other hand, if you
lose your calm when crisis hits seventy miles from land, or while swimming
with big sharks, there is no safety net to catch you.
There have been many years when leaving my New York life felt like
career suicide—my chess rivals were taking lessons and competing in every
weekend tournament while I was on a boat crashing through big waves. But I
would come back with new ideas and a full tank of energy and determination.
The ocean has always healed me, brought me back to life when I have needed
it . . . and as an eight-year-old child in the midst of an existential crisis, I
needed it.
My parents, baby sister, and I left Fort Lauderdale on the Ebb Tide, our
twenty-four-foot Black Fin, a wonderful old ﬁshing boat that carried usthrough many summer adventures in high seas until she blew up and sank
when I was twelve. Fifty-seven miles east southeast was Bimini, an island
that was like home to me. I can still see her coming into sight through my
childhood eyes, those hazy ﬁrst trees like a miracle after a long ocean
crossing. We didn’t talk about chess for weeks. We ﬁshed, dove in warm
crystal-clear water, trolled the Gulf Stream, breathed in the beautiful
southern air. I rediscovered myself as a child, ran around the island with my
friends Kier and Kino, passed countless hours with my head hanging off our
rickety old dock, hand line dangling in the water, watching the ﬁsh dart
around. On rainy evenings, my mom and I would take our dog Brownie and
go into the jungle, hunting for giant land crab. My family reconnected as
human beings, outside of the mad swirl of scholastic chess. I was devastated,
but slowly my parents revived my boyish enthusiasm for life.
In painful times, my mom has always been an anchor, holding everything
together until the clouds roll by. Whe n I was a child, she would press her soft
cheek against mine, reminding me that I didn’t always have to be so tough. I
didn’t have to tell her how I felt—she knew. My mother is the greatest person
I have ever known. She is a brilliant, loving, compassionate woman with a
wisdom that to this day blows my mind. Quietly powerful, inﬁnitely
suppo rtive, absurdly selﬂess, she has always encouraged me to follow my
heart even when it led far away or to seemingly bizarre pursuits. She is also
incredibly brave (sometimes to my dismay), facing do wn four-hundr ed-pound
sharks in deep ocean, hand-lining leaping blue marlin, taming wild two-
thousand-pound stallions, breaking up street ﬁghts, keeping my dad and me
in line. She has been a constant balancing force througho ut all the madness of
our lives—lifting us when we were down, providing perspective when we got
too swept away by ambition, giving a hug when tears ﬂowed. My mom is my
hero. Without her the whole thing falls apart.
My father is a different type of character. He’s a loyal, emotional, eccentric
(think Woody Allen meets Larry David with an adventurous spin), devoted
dad who has been my best friend since day one. I can’t imagine how many
hours we have spent together, playing basketball, throwing around footballs
and baseballs, scouring ocean horizons for birds above schooling ﬁsh,
traveling to chess tournaments and then martial arts championships all over
the world. We have been an elite team since I was six years old and
subsequently have been joined at the hip in our ambitions and, to a certainextent, our emotions. No matter how much perspective we tried to maintain,
our senses of well-being often ﬂuctuated with my competitive results. There
was no way around this. After winning huge  tournaments, all was well and
the sky was the limit. Whe n I was playing badly, everything could look bleak
and our dreams absurd.
It is true that I played with the knowledge that my dad’s heart was on the
line side by side with my own—but  I also knew that he would love me
regardless of the outcome. There is little question that some psychologists
would frown upon such co-dependence between father and son, but when you
are pursuing the pinnacle sometimes limits must be pushed. There are big
games, climactic moments, ﬁnal surges where you dig for energy and
inspiration wherever you can ﬁnd it and pick up the pieces later. One thing is
for sure—through thick and thin, my dad has always been in my corner 100
percent.
After a month on Bimini, my pop got restless and arranged a match
between me and the best chess player on the island. He was worried that I
was taking too long away from the game, and also he was just itching to see
me play again. I wasn’t so eager for the match, preferring to ﬁsh with my
hand line and go diving for lobster. Chess was still a burden to me, but the
idea of the Championship of Bimini sounde d harmless and amusing. We
tracked down the guy and faced off in a bar. He had gold teeth, and a huge
gold necklace hanging down over the board—remnants of a drug-smuggling
past. It took me a few minutes to get into the games but then I came alive,
the old love trickling back. I recall the feeling of inevitability, like chess was
part of me, not to be denied. Something steeled in my eight-year-old self that
summer—I wouldn’t go out a loser.
Whe n I got home in the fall, Bruce was preoccupied with book deadlines
and had no time for me. He cancelled lesson after lesson, which felt like a
terrible slap in the face. I had lost and now my teacher didn’t like me. The
equation was simple. Whe n we did meet, his mind was elsewhere and the
lessons were technical and alienating. Maybe he was busy, but I was a kid in
need.
I also transferred from the Little Red School House to the prestigious
Dalton School on the uppe r east side of Manhattan. The transition was
difﬁcult—instead of a few blocks from home, school was now a long bus ride
away. I missed my friends at Little Red and felt out of place with all the richkids at Dalton. I remember the ﬁrst time a couple of us went over to my new
friend’s apartment uptown and I walked into what seemed like a palace. There
were doormen and maids and chandeliers hanging from duplexed ceilings. I
was confused by all this stuff and began to wonder if my family was somehow
inferior. I am still ashamed of the memory of asking my dad to park around
the corner when he came to pick me up so my friends wouldn’t see our beat-
up green Plymouth that had a shot suspension and an alarming habit of
jumping lanes on the West Side Drive.
I was a mess. My chess life had fallen apart, my teacher didn’t like me
anymore, I missed my friends, and my family didn’t have a doorman or a
fancy car. On top of all this a pretty girl I had a crush on at school had
developed the habit of hitting m e over the head with her shoes, which I didn’t
realize (until she told me many years later) was a sign that she shared my
feelings. I was a child in transition, and I needed some help getting through.
A few weeks into the fall, Bruce saw that rushing through mechanical chess
analysis was not what I needed, and so he took a step back and reconceived
our chess life. Our lessons now included raucous speed chess sessions with
breaks to toss a football outside. We began to laugh and connect as human
beings as we had in our ﬁrst sessions years before.
I went back to playing in Washington Square Park with my old buddi es.
The game became less haunted. I was having fun again. Then Bruce and I
went to work. We plunge d deep into the heart of the art, analyzing complex
middlegame and endga me positions, studying the classics, developing my
technical unde rstanding. We started doing arduous visualization work,
playing blindfold chess games and working through long variations in our
heads, without moving the pieces.
Chess was different now. During those summer months when I questioned
everything and decided to come back strong, I arrived at a commitment to
chess that was about much more than fun and glory. It was about love and
pain and pa ssion and pus hing m yself to overcome. It might sound a bsurd, but
I believe that year, from eight to nine, was the deﬁning period of my life. I
responded to heartbreak with hard work. I was self-motivated and moved by a
powerful resolve. While a young boy, I had been all promise. I only knew
winning because I was better than all the other children and there was no
pressure competing against adults. Now there was the knowledge of mymortality. I had lost to a kid, and there were other children who were also
dangerous rivals.
I was still the highest-rated player for my age in the country, and when I
went to tournaments there was immense pressure. If I won, it was no big
deal, but if I lost it felt like the sky would fall. There was one boy who was
particularly alarming. His name was Jeff Sarwer. He was a scary child—
small, often bald and barefoot. He didn’t go to school and his father had him
studying chess twelve hours a day. Whe n he played, Jeff would chant kill,
kill, kill unde r his breath. The kid was all aggression, brilliant, a powerhouse
over the board. When I had just gotten back from my summer away I arrived
at the Manhattan Chess Club for a lesson with Bruce, and Jeff was sitting
there playing a regular. He approached me with a challenge, which I
accepted. I was rusty and not expecting much of a game—he  blew me away. A
couple of months later I went back to the Manhattan and returned the favor
with a huge  crowd surrounding the board. After I beat him, I heard that he
sat crying in a corner for hours. Terrible. This was a bitter rivalry between
children, and it felt like the end of the earth.
I spent many afternoons studying chess in my room, alone. Sometimes my
dad tried to distract me, lure me away to play football or basketball, and I
would have none of it. There was too much on the line. My parents worried
that I had become too serious about chess, and my dad periodically told me
that it was okay if I wanted to quit. They didn’t unde rstand that quitting was
not an option.
As the Nationals approached, my training got even more intense. I
sharpened myself in the park, soaked in the street-smart advice of my hustler
friends, and did more and more serious work with Bruce. I knew Sarwer was
spending every waking minute working with Grandmasters, honing his razor-
sharp game. He was a machine, annihilating strong adults in speed chess
sessions and then humiliating them with his disdain. One day he showed up
at the park when I wasn’t there, and all my buddi es told him I was better. He
laughe d, and said “Josh is a putz.” They taunted him until he left my home
turf. The New York chess scene was divided between his camp and mine. This
was not child’s play anymore.
The Nationals were again held in Charlotte, North Carolina. I traveled to
the tournament with my parents, baby sister Katya, and Bruce. This was the
ﬁrst tournament to which Bruce had ever come with me. He was not acompetitor at heart and was deeply conﬂicted about children tearing each
other apart unde r such pressure. I don’t really blame him. Three close friends
of mine from Little Red also came to hang out at the tournament with their
parents. They weren’t really chess players—this was more of a vacation for
them. I was deadly serious. I played my games on the ﬁrst board, isolated
from the rest of the children once more. My parents waited in the hotel lobby,
watching my game on a video monitor with throngs of other nervous moms
and dads. My ﬁrst round was difﬁcult, but then I cruised through the ﬁeld,
winning m y ﬁrst six games.
Going into the last round, Jeff Sarwer and I had the only two perfect
scores. I had harder pairings througho ut the event, so if we drew the game I
would win on tie-breaks—but  no one was thinking dr aw.
Jeff was the only kid I was afraid of. Rumor was that he, his father, and
sister had been sleeping in their car througho ut the tournament. Between
rounds he would sit on the ﬂoor, huggi ng his skinny knees and scowling at
anyone who tried to speak to him. He had contempt for other kids, called
them “ugly putzes” and smirked when approached. It would be easy to vilify
him, but Jeff was a child dealt certain cards. His father was a brutal
authoritarian, a messianic ﬁgure who channeled his crazy energy and ideas
into creating the perfect chess machine. Although we never really connected
on a personal level, I had great respect for Jeff. He loved the game and
worked at it harder than anyone I knew. This would be war.
He had the white pieces, a small advantage (white moves ﬁrst) that was
magniﬁed by our particular matchup. I had done a lot of preparation on the
white side of my opening repertoire and was less conﬁde nt with black. He
started the game with tremendous aggression, coming straight after me with
a very dangerous central pawn storm against my King’s Indian Defense. I had
never seen this variation before. He moved quickly, playing with terrifying
conﬁde nce, and I was on the ropes from the start. His central pawn phalanx
seemed to be devouring me, pushing me back before the game even began.
He bristled with cockiness and seemed to mock me, implying that I had no
right to sit at his chessboard.
My chances looked slim right off the bat. Early in the middlegame I lost a
pawn and then I tried to slow down his initiative by trading some pieces.
This is risky—when you are down material, exchanging pieces increases your
opponent’s advantage (consider how the ratio of 5 to 4 compares to 4 to 3; 3to 2; 2 to 1; 1 to 0—a s pieces come off the chessboard, a small material edge
can gradually become overwhelming). But I loved the endga me, and headed
for it like a safe house. Whe n we traded que ens Jeff seemed to snarl at me. He
was an absolute killer, and he  had me by the throat.
After three hours, the tournament hall was empty as we reached the end of
the game. We were alone but for the television camera that was broadcasting
to the hotel lobby where hundr eds of people were gathered around the
monitor, watching and wondering which little kid would be the champ and
which would be crushed. The silence was suffocating—o r maybe that was just
my position. I had a knight and ﬁve pawns against his bishop and six pawns.
It looked hopeless. I remember wrestling with the demons of the previous
year’s heartbreaker while I searched for a way out. Nothing there. I went to
the bathroom and cried. Then I washed my face, steeled myself, buckled
down and w ent back to the board.
It was as if I was trapped in dark jungle, stuck in the unde rbrush, starving,
bleeding and sudde nly there was a little light. I’ll never forget the feeling
when I sensed my potential escape. Often in chess, you feel something is
there before you ﬁnd it. The skin sudde nly perks up, senses heighten like an
animal feeling danger or prey. The unconscious alerts the conscious player
that there is something to be found, and then the search begins. I started
calculating, putting things together. Slowly the plan crystallized in my
mind. I had to take my knight out of play and give up my remaining pawns
to set up a long combination that would leave just two kings on the board—a
completely counterintuitive idea. I found moves that were far beyond my
years to save that game and I’m not really sure how I did it.
We drew the game and I became National Champion. I walked out of the
playing hall in a daze, and was hit by a mob of cheering kids and parents who
had been sucked into the drama of the battle. One coach, an International
Master, asked me why I had made a certain decision in the middlegame and I
had no idea what he was talking about. Chess was already a world away. The
humanity of the moment was overwhelming. I watched Jeff slip around the
crowd and approach his father, who rejected him with a cold stare. It was
awful.CHAPTER 3
TWO APPROACHES TO LEARNING
As you can probably sense, the scholastic chess world is a deadly place. Every
year, thousands of boys and girls put their hearts on the line, each child
believing he or she may be the best. Glory is a powerful incentive. Inevitably
dreams are dashed, hearts are broken, most fall short of their expectations
because there is little room at the top. Of course this dynamic can be found i n
virtually any ambitious ﬁeld. Little League athletes dream of playing for their
favorite Major League team. Kids shooting hoops in the schoolyards want to
be like Mike. The world of actors and musicians is brimming with huge
expectations, wild competitiveness, and a tiny window of realistic possibility.
Two questions arise. First, what is the difference that allows some to ﬁt
into that narrow window to the top? And second, what is the point? If
ambition spells probable disappointment, why pursue excellence? In my
opinion, the answer to both questions lies in a well-thought-out approach
that inspires resilience, the ability to make connections between diverse
pursuits, and day-to-day enjoyment of the process. The vast majority of
motivated people, young and old, make terrible mistakes in their approach to
learning. They fall frustrated by the wayside while those on the road to
success keep steady on their paths.
Developmental psychologists have done extensive research on the effects of
a student’s approach on his or her ability to learn and ultimately master
material. Dr. Carol Dweck, a leading researcher in the ﬁeld of developmental
psychology, makes the distinction between entity and incremental theories of
intelligence. Children who are “entity theorists”—that is, kids who have been
inﬂue nced by their parents and teachers to think in this manner—are prone
to use langua ge like “I am smart at this” and to attribute their success orfailure to an ingrained and unalterable level of ability. They see their overall
intelligence or skill level at a certain discipline to be a ﬁxed entity, a thing
that cannot evolve. Incremental theorists, who have picked up a different
modality of learning—l et’s call them learning theorists—are more prone to
describe their results with sentences like “I got it because I worked very hard
at it” or “I should have tried harder.” A child with a learning theory of
intelligence tends to sense that with hard work, difﬁcult material can be
grasped—step by step, incrementally, the novice can become the master.
Dweck’s research has shown that when challenged by difﬁcult material,
learning theorists are far more likely to rise to the level of the game, while
entity theorists are more brittle and prone to quit. Children who associate
success with hard work tend to have a “mastery-oriented response” to
challenging situations, while children who see themselves as just plain
“smart” or “dumb,” or “good” or “bad” at something, have a “learned
helplessness orientation.”
In one wonderfully revealing study, a group of children was interviewed
and then each child was noted as having either an entity or learning theory of
intelligence. All the children were then given a series of easy math problems,
which they all solved correctly. Then, all the children were given some very
hard problems to solve—problems that were too difﬁcult for them. It was
clear that the learning theorists were excited by the challenge, while the
entity theorists were dismayed. Comments would range from “Oh boy, now
I’m really gonna have to try hard” to “I’m not smart enough for this.”
Everyone got these problems wrong—but  evidently the experience of being
challenged had very different effects. Wha t is most interesting is the third
stage of this experiment: all the children were once again given easy problems
to solve. Nearly all of the learning theorists breezed right through the easy
material, but the entity theorists had been so dispirited by the inability to
solve the hard problems that many of them founde red through the easy stuff.
Their self-conﬁde nce had been destroyed.
Wha t is compelling about this is that the results have nothing to do with
intelligence level. Very smart kids with entity theories tend to be far more
brittle when challenged than kids with learning theories who would be
considered not quite as sharp. In fact, some of the brightest kids prove to be
the most vulnerable to becoming helpless, because they feel the need to live
up to and maintain a perfectionist image that is easily and inevitablyshattered. As an observer of countless talented young chess players, I can
vouch for the accuracy of this point—some of the most gifted players are the
worst unde r pressure, and ha ve the hardest time rebounding from defeat.
How are these theories of intelligence programmed into our minds? Often
subtle differences in parental or instructional style can make a huge
difference. Entity theorists tend to have been told that they did well when
they have succeeded, and that they weren’t any good at something when they
have failed. So a kid aces a math test, comes home, and hears “Wow, that’s my
boy! As smart as they come!” Then, next week Johnny  fails an English test
and hears “Wha t’s wrong with you? Can’t you read?” or “Your Mommy never
liked reading either—obviously, it’s not your thing.” So the boy ﬁgures he’s
good at math and bad at English, and what’s more, he links success and
failure to ingrained ability. Learning theorists, on the other hand, are given
feedback that is more process-oriented. After doing well on an English essay,
a little girl might be congratulated by her teacher with “Wow, great job
Julie! You’re really becoming a wonderful writer! Keep up the good work!”
And if she does badly on a math test, her teacher might write “Study a little
harder for the next one and you’ll do great! And feel free to ask me questions
any time after class, that’s what I’m here for!” So Julie learns to associate
effort with success and feels that she can become good at anything with some
hard work. She also feels as though she is on a journey of learning, and her
teacher is a friendly assistant in her growth. Johnny  thinks he’s good at math
and bad at English, and he focuses on quick results as opposed to long-term
process—but  what happens when he does badly on a hard math test down the
line? Will he be prepared to learn the right lessons from life’s inevitable
challenges? Unfortunately, he may not.
It is clear that parents and teachers have an enormous responsibility in
forming the theories of intelligence of their students and children—a nd it is
never too late. It is critical to realize that we can always evolve in our
approaches to learning. Studies have shown that in just minutes, kids can be
conditioned into having a healthy learning theory for a given situation. In
one study, children were given different instructions about what the aim of
their task was. Some kids were told that solving certain problems would help
them with their schoolwork in the future, and other kids were told that they
would be judge d based on their results. In other words, half the kids received
“mastery-oriented” instructions, and half the kids received “helplessness-producing” instructions. Needless to say, the kids who were temporarily
mastery-oriented did much better on the tests.
So how does all this affect us in our day-to-day lives? Funda mentally. The
key to pursuing excellence is to embrace an organic, long-term learning
process, and not to live in a shell of static, safe mediocrity. Usually, growth
comes at the expense of previous comfort or safety. The hermit crab is a
colorful example of a creature that lives by this aspect of the growth process
(albeit without our psychological baggage). As the crab gets bigger, it needs
to ﬁnd a more spacious shell. So the slow, lumbering creature goes on a quest
for a new home. If an appropriate new shell is not found quickly, a terribly
delicate moment of truth arises. A soft creature that is used to the protection
of built-in armor must now go out into the world, exposed to predators in all
its mushy vulnerability. That learning phase in between shells is where our
growth can spring from. Someone stuck with an entity theory of intelligence
is like an anorexic hermit crab, starving itself so it doesn’t grow to have to
ﬁnd a  new shell.
In my experience, successful people shoot for the stars, put their hearts on
the line in every battle, and ultimately discover that the lessons learned from
the pursuit of excellence mean much more than the immediate trophies and
glory. In the long run, painful losses may prove much more valuable than
wins—those who are armed with a healthy attitude and are able to draw
wisdom from every experience, “good” or “bad,” are the ones who make it
down the road. They are also the ones who are happier along the way. Of
course the real challenge is to stay in range of this long-term perspective
when you are unde r ﬁre and hurting in the middle of the war. This, maybe
our biggest hurdle, is at the core of the art of learning.

Let’s return to the scholastic chess world, and focus on the ingredients to my
early success. I mentioned that Bruce and I studied the endga me while other
young players focused on the opening. In light of the entity/incremental
discussion, I’d like to plunge  a little more deeply into the approach that
Bruce and I adopted.
Rewind to those days when I was a six-year-old prankster. Once he had
won my conﬁde nce, Bruce began our study with a barren chessboard. We tookon positions of reduced complexity and clear principles. Our ﬁrst focus was
king and pawn against king—j ust three pieces on the table. Over time, I
gained an excellent intuitive feel for the power of the king and the subtlety of
the pawn. I learned the principle of opposition, the hidden potency of empty
space, the idea of zugzwang (putting your opponent in a position where any
move he makes will destroy his position). Layer by layer we built up my
knowledge and my understanding of how to transform axioms into fuel for creative
insight. Then we turned to rook endings, bishop endings, knight endings,
spending hundr eds of hours as I turned seven and eight years old, exploring
the operating principles behind positions that I might never see again. This
method of study gave me a feeling for the beautiful subtleties of each chess
piece, because in relatively clear-cut positions I could focus on what was
essential. I was also gradually internalizing a marvelous methodology of
learning—t he play between knowledge, intuition, and creativity. From both
educational and technical perspectives, I learned from the founda tion up.
Most of my rivals, on the other hand, began by studying opening
variations. There is a vast body of theory that begins from the starting
position of all chess games, and it is very tempting to teach children
openings right off the bat, because built into this theoretical part of the game
there are many imbedded traps, land mines that allow a player to win quickly
and easily—in effect, to win without having to struggle to win. At ﬁrst
thought, it seems logical for a novice to study positions that he or she will see
all the time at the outset of games. Why  not begin from the beginning,
especially if it leads to instant success? The answer is quicksand. Once you
start with openings, there is no way out. Lifetimes can be spent memorizing
and keeping up with the evolving Encyclopedia of Chess Openings (ECO).
They are an addiction, with perilous psychological effects.
It is a little like developing the habit of stealing the test from your
teacher’s desk instead of learning how to do the math. You may pass the test,
but you learn absolutely nothing—a nd most critically, you don’t gain an
appreciation for the value or beauty of learning itself. For children who focus
early on openings, chess becomes about results. Period. It doesn’t matter how
you played or if you concentrated well or if you were brave. These kids talk
about the 4 move mate and ask each other, “How many moves did it take you
to win”? Chess becomes one-dimensional—winning and w inning fast.Children who begin their chess education by memorizing openings tend to
internalize an entity theory of intelligence. Their dialogues with teachers,
parents, and other children are all about results, not effort. They consider
themselves winners because so far they have won. In school, they focus on
what comes easy to them and ignore the subjects that are harder. On the
playground, they use the famous “I wasn’t trying” after missing a shot or
striking out.
Once I was in Arizona giving a lecture and simultaneous exhibitionI to a
large group of young chess players and parents, and the organizer of the event
picked me up at the airport bragging that his son hadn’t lost a chess game in
over a year. Obviously this was a record the whole family was proud of. I
knew what was coming—c lassic anorexic hermit crab. Whe n I met the child,
he was a moderately talented boy who was the best in his school. He had
learned some quick opening attacks and had a natural feel for basic chess
tactics. Clearly he had started winning and had been praised effusively for his
genius. As a result, the boy refused to play anyone outside of the circle of
friends and competitors whom he knew to be inferior (his favorite opponent
was his father, who was a weak player and no challenge at all). To his school
buddi es, this boy was a chess god, but compared to serious chess-playing
children around the country, he had a long way to go. He was a big ﬁsh in a
small pond and he liked it that way. The boy avoided chess througho ut my
visit. He didn’t want to play in the simultaneous exhibition and was the only
child at the event who was resistant to instruction. His winning streak and
the constant talk of it had him all locked up—he  was terriﬁed of shattering
the façade of perfection. This child was paralyzed by an ever-deepening cycle
of entity indoctrination.
Many kids like this are quite talented, so they excel at ﬁrst because of
good genes—but  then they hit a roadblock. As chess struggles become more
intense and opponents put up serious resistance, they start to lose interest in
the game. They try to avoid challenges, but eventually the real world ﬁnds
them. Their conﬁde nce is fragile. Losing is always a crisis instead of an
opportunity for growth—if they were a winner because they won, this new
losing m ust make them a loser.
The long-term effects of “opening madness” are clear, but there are also
serious immediate weaknesses in young chess players brought up in this
environment. Just as there are inevitable ups and downs in a career, there arealso momentum shifts in individual games. Most of my early rivals were
gifted children, and they were prepared with hundr eds of traps with which
they could win right off the bat. Playing against these kids was like walking
through a mineﬁeld, but I was good enough on my feet to navigate most of
the danger. I often came out of the openings in a little bit of trouble, but
then I took control. As our games progressed, my opponents moved away
from their area of comfort while I grew stronger and more conﬁdent. They
wanted to win before the battle began, but I loved the struggle that was the
heart of chess. In both the short term and the long term, these kids were
crippled by the horizon imposed on them by their teachers.
The problem in the chess world is that many coaches work in schools with
an ever-replenishing annua l supply of talented young children. These kids are
like raw material in a factory. Each year, the teachers are expected to provide
results because having a nationally ranked chess team is prestigious for the
school. So the coaches create a legion of entity-theorizing, tactically gifted
young chess players who are armed to the teeth with a brutal opening
repertoire. It doesn’t matter if these kids will hit a crisis in seventh grade,
because all that counts for the coach are the primary and elementary school
divisions and there are always more ﬁrst-graders coming up the pipe. Clearly,
parents bear an enormous responsibility in navigating these issues and
choosing the right teacher for their child.
I have used chess to illustrate this entity/incremental dynamic, but the
issue is funda mental to the pursuit of excellence in all ﬁelds. If a young
basketball player is taught that winning is the only thing that winners do,
then he will crumble when he misses his ﬁrst big shot. If a gymnast or ballet
dancer is taught that her self-worth is entirely wrapped up in a perfectly
skinny body that is always ready for performance, then how can she handle
injuries or life after an inevitably short career? If a businessperson cultivates a
perfectionist self-image, then how can she learn from her mistakes?
Whe n I reﬂect back on my chess career, I remember the losses, and the
lessons learned from defeat. I remember losing that ﬁrst National
Championship to David Arnett. I remember being crushed by my archrival in
a sudde n-death playoff of the U.S. Junior (Under 21) Championship a year
before I won the tournament outright. Then there was the ﬁnal round of the
Under 18 W orld Chess Championship in Szeged, Hunga ry. I was on board one
competing against the Russian for the world title—inches from a life’sdream, I was offered a draw, a chance to share the glory. All I had to do was
shake hands, but I declined, pushed for a win, and lost—such agony! These
moments in my life were wracked with pain, but they were also deﬁning gut-
checks packed with potential. The setbacks taught me how to succeed. And
what kept me on my path was a love for learning that has its roots in my ﬁrst
chess lessons as a six-year-old boy.
I. A simultaneous exhibition, also referred to as a “simul,” is an event where one stronger chess player
competes against a large number of opponents. When I give simuls, usually there is a preceding
competition to determine who will play me. Then 20–50 boards are set up in a large square of a
banquet hall, and I walk from table to table inside the square while my opponents sit at their board
and play one chess game. When I arrive at a board, the other makes his or her move. I then respond
and move onto the next board. Simuls are an excellent way to demonstrate the understanding and
visualization skills of a strong player.CHAPTER 4
LOVING THE GAME
After I won my ﬁrst National Championship, my chess life started gathering
momentum. My passion for the game fueled a long ride of unhindered
learning and inspired performance. From nine to seventeen, I was the top-
ranked player for my age in the country. I won eight individual National
Championship titles, captained my school to winning seven team Nationals,
and represented America in six World Championships. These were years of
tremendous growth, and as I got deeper into the heart of chess, the art
became a riveting w indow of self-exploration.
A key ingredient to my success in those years was that my style on the
chessboard was a direct expression of my personality. It is my nature to revel
in apparent chaos. I’ve always loved thunde rstorms, blizzards, hurricanes,
rough seas, sharky waters. Since childhood, inclement conditions have
inspired me, and as a young competitor I would guide critical chess games
into positions of tremendous complexity with the conﬁde nce that I would be
able to sort through the mayhem more effectively than my opponents. I often
sensed a logical thread to positions that seemed irrational—playing exciting
chess felt like discovering hidden harmonies. I was a free-ﬂowing performer,
unblocked by psychological issues and hunge ring for creative leaps.
One of the most critical strengths of a superior competitor in any
discipline—whether we are speaking about sports, business negotiations, or
even presidential debates—is the ability to dictate the tone of the battle.
Many of my young chess rivals preferred to keep the game in control. They
played openings that they had memorized, played them over and over again.
They hankered for rating points, calculated what the next result would do to
their national ranking, and their materialistic dispositions made themuncomfortable in the stormy positions in which I thrived. Because of my
classical chess education and my love for the endga me as well as crazy
middlegames, I was usually able to move the position toward one of my
strengths.
Things got a bit more complicated when I was ten years old and I started
to compete almost exclusively in adult tournaments, only playing kids in the
Nationals or World Championships. This was a big change because highly
experienced tournament players could often guide the chess position into
closed, strategical battles which were not to my liking. As I cultivated my
strengths, I also had to take on the more abstract elements of high-level chess
so I could compete effectively with more seasoned opponents. Just as muscles
get stronger when they are pushed, good competitors tend to rise to the level
of the opposition. The adult chess world toughe ned me up, made me
introspective and always on the lookout for ﬂaws to be improved on. A bonus
to playing grown-ups is that whenever I competed in a scholastic Nationals I
had tremendous conﬁde nce—these were only kids after all.
The transition to open tournaments also forced me to take on the issue of
endurance. In scholastic events, a single chess game rarely lasts more than
three hours. In most adult competitions, each player has to make his or her
ﬁrst forty moves in two hours (a four-hour time control). Then there is an
additional hour for each player for every succeeding twenty moves. If enough
moves are played, a game can continue for what feels to a child like eternity.
Older opponents know that kids have less stamina for long battles, so they
sometimes made the games drag on to tire me out. Once in Philadelphia, a
ruthless fellow made me play for over nine hours. I was ten years old and he
sat stalling at the board in front of obvious moves for forty-ﬁve minutes at a
time. It was terrible, but a lesson learned. On top of everything else, I had to
develop the ability to run a mental marathon.
Chess was a constant challenge. My whole career, my father and I searched
out opponents who were a little stronger than me, so even as I dominated the
scholastic circuit, losing was part of my regular experience. I believe this was
important for maintaining a healthy perspective on the game. While there
was a lot of pressure on my shoulders, fear of failure didn’t move me so much
as an intense passion for the game. I think the arc of losing a heartbreaker
before winning m y ﬁrst big title gave me license to compete on the edge.This is not to say that losing didn’t hurt. It did. There is something
particularly painful about being beaten in a chess game. In the course of a
battle, each player puts every ounce of his or her tactical, strategical,
emotional, physical, and spiritual being into the struggle. The brain is
pushed through terrible trials; we stretch every ﬁber of our mental capacity;
the whole body aches from exhaustion after hours of rapt concentration. In
the course of a dynamic chess ﬁght, there will be shifts in momentum, near
misses, narrow escapes, innovative creations, and precise refutations. Whe n
your position teeters on the brink of disaster, it feels like your life is on the
line. When you win, you survive another day. Whe n you lose, it is as if
someone has torn out your heart and stepped on it. No exaggeration. Losing
is brutal.
This brings up an incipient danger in what may appear to be an
incremental approach. I have seen many people in diverse ﬁelds take some
version of the process-ﬁrst philosophy and transform it into an excuse for
never putting themselves on the line or pretending not to care about results.
They claim to be egoless, to care only about learning, but really this is an
excuse to avoid confronting themselves. This issue of process vs. goal is very
delicate, and I want to carefully deﬁne how I feel the question should be
navigated.
It would be easy to read about the studies on entity vs. incremental
theories of intelligence and come to the conclusion that a child should never
win or lose. I don’t believe this is the case. If that child discovers any
ambition to pursue excellence in a given ﬁeld later in life, he or she may lack
the toughne ss to handle inevitable obstacles. While a ﬁxation on results is
certainly unhe althy, short-term goals can be useful developmental tools if
they are balanced within a nurturing long-term philosophy. Too much
sheltering from results can be stunting. The road to success is not easy or else
everyone would be the greatest at what they do—we need to be
psychologically prepared to face the unavoidable challenges along our way,
and when it comes down to it, the only way to learn how to swim is by
getting in the water.
Let’s put ourselves in the shoes of the mother of a talented young chess
player I know named Danny. This seven-year-old boy just loves chess. He
can’t get enough. He studies chess for a half hour every day, plays on the
Internet, and takes a lesson from an expert once a week. He has recentlystarted competing in scholastic chess tournaments, and the mother ﬁnds
herself swept away by the exciting atmosphere. She ﬁnds her own sense of
well-being ﬂuctuating with Danny’s wins and losses. This woman is a
substantial, sensitive, intelligent person and she doesn’t want to put an extra
burden on her son’s shoulders. She is aware of the entity/incremental dynamic
and so when Danny loses, she wants to tell him it doesn’t matter. But
obviously it does matter. He lost and is sad. To tell him it doesn’t matter is
almost to insult his intelligence. Wha t should she do?
This real-life dynamic has parallels in virtually every ﬁeld, although we
are often our own parent in the moment. How can we balance long-term
process with short-term goals and inevitable setbacks? Let’s dive in. Danny is
an intelligent boy who has decided to dedicate himself for the time being to
chess. He loves the challenge of facing off with other young minds and
stretching himself to think a little further and more accurately than he could
the day before. There is nothing like a worthy opponent to show us our
weaknesses and push us to our limit. It is good for Danny to compete, but it
is essential that he do so in a healthy manner.
First of all, in the spirit of the previous chapter, Danny’s mom can help
him internalize a process-ﬁrst approach by making her everyday feedback
respond to effort over results. She should praise good concentration, a good
day’s work, a lesson learned. Whe n he wins a tournament game, the spotlight
should be on the road to that moment and beyond as opposed to the glory. On
the other hand, it is okay for a child (or an adult for that matter) to enjoy a
win. A parent shouldn’t be an automaton, denying the obvious emotional
moment to spout platitudes about the long-term learning process when her
child is jumping up and down with excitement. Whe n we have worked hard
and succeed at something, we should be allowed to smell the roses. The key,
in my opinion, is to recognize that the beauty of those roses lies in their
transience. It is drifting away even as we inhale. We enjoy the win fully while
taking a deep breath, then we exhale, note the lesson learned, and move on to
the next adventure.
Whe n Danny loses, the stakes will feel a bit higher. Now he comes out of
the tournament room a little teary. He put his heart on the line and lost.
How should his mom handle this moment? First of all, she shouldn’t say that
it doesn’t matter, because Danny knows better than that and lying about the
situation isolates Danny in his pain. If it didn’t matter, then why should hetry to win? Why  should he study chess and waste their weekends at
tournaments? It matters and Danny knows that. So empathy is a good place
to start.
I think this mother should give her son a hug. If he is crying, let him cry
on her shoulder. She should tell him how proud of him she is. She can tell
Danny that it is okay to be sad, that she unde rstands and that she loves him.
Disappointment is a part of the road to greatness. Whe n a few moments pass,
in a quiet voice, she can ask Danny if he knows what happened in the game.
Hopefully the langua ge between parent and child will already be established
so Danny knows his mom is asking about psychology, not chess moves
(almost all mistakes have both technical and mental components—the chess
lessons should be left for after the tournament, when Danny and his teacher
study the games). Did he lose his concentration? Did he fall into a downward
spiral and make a bunc h of mistakes in a row? Was he overconﬁde nt?
Impatient? Did he get psyched out by a trash talker? Was he tired? Danny
will have an idea about his psychological slip, and taking on that issue will be
a short-term goal in the continuing process—introspective thinking of this
nature can be a very healthy coping mechanism. Through these dialogues,
Danny will learn that every loss is an opportunity for growth. He will become
increasingly astute psychologically and sensitive to bad habits.
A heartfelt, empathetically present, incrementally inspiring mom or dad
or coach can liberate an ambitious child to take the world by the horns. As
adults, we have to take responsibility for ourselves and nurture a healthy,
liberated mind-set. We need to put ourselves out there, give it our all, and
reap the lesson, win or lose. The fact of the matter is that there will be
nothing learned from any challenge in which we don’t try our hardest.
Growth comes at the point of resistance. We learn by pushing ourselves and
ﬁnding w hat really lies at the outer reaches of our abilities.
*  *  *
As I matured as a chess player, there were constantly leaps into the unkno wn.
Because of my growth curve, my life was like that hermit crab who never ﬁts
into the same shell for more than a few days. I would have to learn esoteric,
initially uncomfortable types of chess positions. I would take on dangerous
new rivals who recently emigrated from Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union.I’d travel to distant countries to compete and need to adapt to the alien
cultural and chessic customs on the spur of the moment.
I remember when I was eleven years old I went to Timisoara, Romania to
represent America in the World Championship for everyone unde r the age of
twelve. Each country sends their champion, and we go to battle. My dad and I
had trouble ﬁnding the competition site on the opening day and I arrived late
to the ﬁrst round. Whe n I ﬁnally got to my seat across from the National
Champion of Qatar, there were thirty minutes already off my clock—a  large
disadvantage. To make matters worse, I didn’t recognize any pieces on the
chessboard. The untraditional chess set the Romanians had chosen for the
tournament was completely bizarre to me. I was sitting in front of a game I
had never seen before—like one of my childhood nightmares where I couldn’t
remember how to move the pieces and cameras were ﬂashing in my face. The
moment was quite alarming.
It turns out that I handled the situation pretty well. I took a few deep
breaths, made my opening move, and played somewhere between blindfold
and looking at the board. Chess was in my blood even if that set was not. I
moved quickly to catch up on the clock, calculated in my head as I had done
so often in training, and won that ﬁrst round without much trouble. Then I
spent much of the evening getting used to the chess pieces and had an
excellent tournament over the next two weeks.
One of the more emotional movements in my young life came as I was
turning eleven years old and had to make the painful transition away from
my ﬁrst teacher, Bruce Pandolﬁni. I loved Bruce, he was part of my family,
but I was improving quickly and he just wasn’t a strong enough player to
keep on coaching me. Bruce was a National Master who hadn’t been active in
tournaments in years, and I was already approaching his level. We found a
wonderful new coach, Chilean International Master Victor Frias, who in time
would become a very dear friend of my family. Breaking from Bruce felt like
losing a part of myself.
That same year, my father’s brutally honest book Searching for Bobby Fischer
was released around the world. It was a beautifully written account of our
journey together during my rise to winning my ﬁrst national title and years
later it would inspire the Paramount ﬁlm of the same name. I was already
well-known in the chess world, but now I was really out there, which put
some extra pressure on my shoulders. I went on all the television shows withmy awkward adolescent afro and goofy smile. Jane Pauley on The Today Show
asked me whether I wanted to be like Bobby Fischer. Just then the music
started playing, which meant I had ﬁve seconds to answer, and I knew Bobby
Fischer was crazy so I came out with the brilliant closer: “No, I never want to
be like Bobby Fischer, again.” Again? Wha t is this kid talking about?
I was having a great time and was just innocent enough to avoid being
messed up by the spotlight. I dove deeper and deeper into chess. Of course
there were plateaus, periods when my results leveled off while I internalized
the information necessary for my next growth spurt, but I didn’t mind. I had
a burning love for chess and so I pushed through the rocky periods with a
can-do attitude. I became a Chess Master a few days after turning thirteen,
beating Fischer’s mark of thirteen years ﬁve months. People were saying that
I was a future World Champion, but I didn’t hear them. I was a competitor
who knew winning and losing and the hair’s breadth between. My rivals
didn’t care about reputation—they just wanted to crush me and I had to keep
it real.
There were a few powerful moments that reinforced my young notion that
glory had little to do with happiness or long-term success. I’ll never forget
walking out of the playing hall of the 1990 Elementary School National
Championships after winning the title game. There were over 1,500
competitors at the event, all the strongest young players from around the
country. I had just won the whole thing . . . and everything felt normal. I
stood in the convention hall looking around. There was no eupho ria, no
opening of the heavens. The world was the same as it had been a few days
before. I was Josh. I had a great mom and dad and a cute little sister Katya
who was fun to play with. I loved chess and sports and girls and ﬁshing.
Whe n I would go back to school on Monday, my friends would say
“Awright!” like they did after hitting a jump shot, and then it would be in
the past and w e would go play football.CHAPTER 5
THE SOFT ZONE
“Lose Yourself”
World Junior Chess Championship Calicut, India November 1993
I was sixteen years old, sitting at a chessboard in Calicut, India. Sweat dripped down
my sides as I battled to stay focused in the sweltering heat. The sun was high, the air
still, the room stuffed with rustling world-class thinkers. I had traveled from New
York City to represent America in the World Championship for chess players under the
age of twenty-one. Each country sent its national champion to compete in a grueling
two-week marathon of pure concentration, endurance, calculation, strategy—all-out
psychological war. My father and I had ﬂown into Bombay a week earlier and had
traveled south to the event, where I met my girlfriend, who was representing Slovenia
in the women’s division of the tournament. She was a brilliant girl, gorgeous,
otherworldly, ﬁercely intense, moody, my ﬁrst love. Tormented love and war, a
complicated mix. Less than ideal for World Championship competition, but the life of
a top chess player is a strange one. Brutal competition mixes with intense friendships.
Players try to destroy their opponents, to ruin their lives, and then they reﬂect on the
battle, lick their wounds, cull the lessons, and take a walk.
From one perspective the opponent is the enemy. On the other hand there is no one
who knows you more intimately, no one who challenges you so profoundly or pushes you
to excellence and growth so relentlessly. Sitting at a chessboard, just feet away from
the other, you can hear every breath, feel each quiver, sense any ﬂicker of fear or
exhilaration. Hours pass with your entire being tapping into your opponent’s psyche,
while the other follows your thoughts like a shadow and yearns for your demise.
Brilliant minds all around the world devote themselves to the intense study of thismysterious, brutal intellectual sport, and then the best of them collide in distant
outposts.
Here I was, in a strange faraway land, sweating in the oppressive heat, trying to
ﬁnd my beloved art in the ﬁgurines in front of me. Above me thousands of spectators
hung from the rafters, whispering, staring at the chessboards like Sutra—somehow
chess and India resonate like ancient lovers. I was disjointed, out of whack, not yet
settled into the rhythm of the tournament. Even for the master, sometimes chess can feel
like home, and sometimes it can be completely alienating, a foreign jungle that must be
explored as if for the ﬁrst time. I was trying to ﬁnd my way home.
Across from me was the Indian National Champion, and between the two of us lay
the critical position of our struggle. We were three hours into the battle and I had been
thinking for twenty minutes. A curious thing happened in that time. So far I had been
grinding my way through this game. It was the ﬁrst round, I had no ﬂow, no inspired
ideas, the pieces were alien, the position strange. After about ten minutes of thought, I
began to lose myself in the variations. It is a strange feeling. First you are a person
looking at a chessboard. You calculate through the various alternatives, the mind
gaining speed as it pores through the complexities, until consciousness of one’s
separation from the position ebbs away and what remains is the sensation of being
inside the energetic chess ﬂow. Then the mind moves with the speed of an electrical
current, complex problems are breezed through with an intuitive clarity, you get deeper
and deeper into the soul of the chess position, time falls away, the concept of “I” is
gone, all that exists is blissful engagement, pure presence, absolute ﬂow. I was in the
zone and then there was an earthquake.
Everything started to shake and the lights went out. The rafters exploded with
noise, people ran out of the building. I sat still. I knew what was happening, but I
experienced it from within the chess position. There was a surreal synergy of me and
no me, pure thought and the awareness of a thinker—I wasn’t me looking at the chess
position, but I was aware of myself and the shaking world from within the serenity of
pure engagement—and then I solved the chess problem. Somehow the earthquake and
the dying lights spurred me to revelation. I had a crystallization of thought,
resurfaced, and vacated the trembling playing room. When I returned and play
resumed, I immediately made my move and went on to win the game.
*  *  *This intense moment of my life was the launching point for my serious
investigation of the nuances of performance psychology. I had used an
earthqua ke to reach a higher state of consciousness and discover a chess
solution I may not have otherwise found. As this book evolves, I will
gradually lay out my current methodology for triggering such states of
creative ﬂow. Eventually, by systematically training oneself, a competitor can
learn how to do this at will. But the ﬁrst obstacle I had to overcome as a
young chess player was to avoid being distracted by random, unexpected
events—by  the mini earthqua kes that afﬂict all of our days. In performance
training, ﬁrst we learn to ﬂow with whatever comes. Then we learn to use
whatever comes to our advantage. Finally, we learn to be completely self-
sufﬁcient and create our own earthqua kes, so our mental process feeds itself
explosive inspirations without the need for outside stimulus.
The initial step along this path is to attain what sports psychologists call
The Soft Zone. Envision the Zone as your performance state.I
You are concentrated on the task at hand, whether it be a piece of music, a
legal brief, a ﬁnancial document, driving a car, anything. Then something
happens. Maybe your spouse comes home, your baby wakes up and starts
screaming, your boss calls you with an unreasonable demand, a truck has a
blowout in front of you. The nature of your state of concentration will
determine the ﬁrst phase of your reaction—if you are tense, with your ﬁnge rs
jammed in your ears and your whole body straining to ﬁght off distraction,
then you are in a Hard Zone that demands a cooperative world for you to
function. Like a dry twig, you are brittle, ready to snap unde r pressure. The
alternative is for you to be quietly, intensely focused, apparently relaxed with
a serene look on your face, but inside all the mental juices are churning. You
ﬂow with whatever comes, integrating every ripple of life into your creative
moment. This Soft Zone is resilient, like a ﬂexible blade of grass that can
move with and survive hurricane-force winds.
Another way of envisioning the importance of the Soft Zone is through an
ancient Indian parable that has been quite instructive in my life for many
years: A man wants to walk across the land, but the earth is covered with
thorns. He has two options—one is to pave his road, to tame all of nature
into compliance. The other is to make sandals. Making sandals is the internal
solution. Like the Soft Zone, it does not base success on a submissive world or
overpowering force, but on intelligent preparation and cultivated resilience.My relationship to this issue of coping with distraction began with the
quirkiness of a ten-year-old boy. In the last chapter I mentioned that as my
chess understanding grew more sophisticated and I transitioned to adult
tournaments, my games tended to last longer, sometimes going on for six or
eight hours. Kids have trouble focusing for so long and strange things can
happen to a young mind straining unde r intense pressure. One day I was
working my way through a complex position in a tournament at the
Manhattan Chess Club, and a Bon Jovi song I had heard earlier in the day
entered my mind. I tried to push it away and return to my calculation, but it
just wouldn’t leave me alone. At ﬁrst this seemed funny, but soon the music
eclipsed the chess game. I couldn’t think, and ended up blunde ring and
losing.
Soon enough, this problem became rampant in my chess life. If I heard a
particularly catchy tune at home or on the way to a tournament, I would
sometimes be haunted by it for days. This might sound trivial, but for me it
was disastrous—there I’d be, eleven years old, facing down a wily old chess
master, and the theme song from Ghostbusters would be hammering away in
my brain. The more I tried to block out the distraction, the louder it would
get in my head. As a young boy I felt alone with this problem, but in recent
years while lecturing on performance psychology, I have found that many
high-stress performers have similar symptoms.
Over time, as I became more and more ﬁxated on irritating mental music,
I started being bothered by noises I had never even noticed before. In a silent
playing hall, the sound of a distant ambulance or whispering spectators can
be an uproar. A ticking chess clock can be a telltale heart, pounding like
thunde r in your mind. I was having terrible and hi larious noise problems, and
then one day I had a breakthrough. I was playing a tournament in
Philadelphia with a Phil Collins song rattling away in my brain when I
realized that I could think to the beat of the song. My chess calculations
began to move to the rhythm of the music, and I played an inspired game.
After this moment, I took the bull by the horns and began training to have a
more resilient concentration. I realized that in top-rank competition I
couldn’t count on the world being silent, so my only option was to become at
peace with the noise.
The victims of my training method were my parents and sister. A few
times a week, while studying chess in my bedroom, I blasted music.Sometimes it was music I liked, sometimes music I didn’t like. For a period
of many months I blared booming Gyuto monk chants, which drove my
sister, Katya, to utter distraction. My family’s little apartment was besieged
by my bizarre training concept, and it’s amazing they put up with me. My
idea was to become at peace with distraction, whatever it was. During this
period of time, in my early teens, I frequented chess shops near my home and
played speed chess in clouds of smoke, which I have always hated. Of course I
also played in Washington Square Park, where consistent kibitzing and a
steady stream of chess banter is part of the game. There was no blocking out
the noise or smoke, and my only option was to integrate my environment
into my creative process. So if Bon Jovi was playing, I might be prone to play
a bit more aggressively than when I had on quiet classical music. The Gyuto
monk chants pounde d me into fascinating chessic discoveries. Voices in the
park inspired me as they had when I was a young boy. The smoke I learned to
live with.
As I turned fourteen and then ﬁfteen years old, my Soft Zone training was
really put to the test. The competition for the top of the American scholastic
chess ranking was stiffened by a tremendous inﬂux  of Soviet immigrants. As
the Soviet Union fell apart, many of the powerful Russian players looked for
opportunity in the west. These kids were highly trained, excellent ﬁghters,
who had been schooled in the famous Pioneers’ Palaces of Moscow and
Leningrad.II Many of these new rivals were armed with a repertoire of
psychological “tricks” that presented serious challenges.
One of the more interesting tactics was implemented by a Russian boy
whom I had trouble with for a period of months before I caught on to his
game. He was a very strong player so our clashes were always tense, but for
some reason I tended to make careless errors against him in the critical
positions. Then one day, an old Bulgarian Master named Rudy Blumenfeld
approached my father in the Marshall Chess Club and asked him if we were
aware of what this boy was doing to me. We were not. He explained that in
the climactic moments of the struggle, when I had to buckle down and
patiently work my way through the complications to ﬁnd a precise solution,
this boy would start to tap a chess piece on the side of the table, barely
audible, but at a pace that entered and slightly quickened my mental process.
This subtle tactic was highly effective and I later found out that it was an
offspring of the Soviet study of hypnosis and mind control. The next time weplayed, I was on the lookout for the tapping and sure enough, in the critical
moment it was right there. Hilarious. Once I was aware of what was
happening, I was able to turn the tables in our rivalry.
Some of the other young Russian players were far less subtle, and had
“tricks” that crossed the borders of sporting ethics. One of these boys, who
was my archrival for years, had the habit of kicking me unde r the table
during the critical moments of a game. He would also get up from the board
at tournaments and talk about the position in Russian with his coach, a
famous Grandmaster. There were complaints, but little was done to stop the
cheating. No one could prove what was discussed because of the langua ge
barrier, and the truth is that it didn’t even matter. While valuable chess ideas
might have been exchanged, the psychological effect was much more critical.
Opponents felt helpless and wronged—they took on the mentality of victim
and so half the battle was already lost. More than once, I watched top young
American players reduced to tears by this kid—but  these dirty tactics were
not reserved for local soil.
In 1993, when we were sixteen, this Russian boy and I both traveled to
India to jointly represent America in the World Under 21 Championship and
a formal protest was lodged against the American team by seven or eight
delegations because he was blatantly cheating at the event. Competitors from
all over the world approached me and demanded to know how the Americans
could do such a thing. I was embarrassed to be associated with this kid and
his seedy repertoire.
As a result of this shift of tone in the U.S. scholastic scene, many of my
American contemporaries became dispirited and quit the game. The Russian
kids were great players who presented a whole new set of challenges, and
instead of adapting and raising their games, American kids dropped out. For
my part, the new crew of brilliant Machiavellian rivals made me buckle
down. I had my home turf to defend and the ﬁrst step would be to learn how
to handle dirty opponents without losing my cool. Sometimes noticing the
psychological tactic was enough to render it harmless—but  in the case of the
kicking and barefaced cheating, I really had to take on my emotions. These
breaks from etiquette were outrageous in the chess world and I was appalled.
The problem is that when I got angry, I was thrown off my game. I tried to
stay level-headed, but this one rival of mine had no limits. He would push
me to the point of utter exasperation and I would often self-destruct.I have come to believe that the solution to this type of situation does not
lie in denying our emotions, but in learning to use them to our advantage.
Instead of stiﬂing m yself, I needed to channel my mood into heightened focus
—and I can’t honestly say that I ﬁgured out how to do this consistently until
years into my martial arts career when dirty opponents tried to take out my
knees, target the groin, or head-butt me in the nose in competition.III
My whole life I have worked on this issue. Mental resilience is arguably
the most critical trait of a world-class performer, and it should be nurtured
continuously. Left to my own devices, I am always looking for ways to become
more and more psychologically impregnable. Whe n uncomfortable, my
instinct is not to avoid the discomfort but to become at peace with it. Whe n
injured, which happens frequently in the life of a martial artist, I try to avoid
painkillers and to change the sensation of pain into a feeling that is not
necessarily negative. My instinct is always to seek out challenges as opposed
to avoiding them.
This type of internal work can take place in the little moments of our
lives. I mentioned how my style over the board was to create chessic mayhem
and then to sort my way through the chaos more effectively than my
opponents. This was a muscle I built up by training myself to be at peace
with the unclear and tumultuous—and most of the training was in everyday
life. For example, since my teens, when I play cards, say gin rummy, I rarely
arrange my hand. I leave the melds all over the place and do the organization
in my head. I’ve never been a neat guy by nature, and I furthered my
messiness for years by consciously leaving my living area chaotic so I could
practice organizing things mentally and be ing m ellow in the madness.
Of course this process is never complete. As I am writing this section, a
lawn mower just went into gear right outside. A few minutes ago I got up to
close the window, but then I sat back down and left it open. The irony was
too thick.
I. The chapter Building Your Trigger in Part III of this book, will lay out my methodology for
cultivating the ability to enter the zone at will.
II. Pioneers’ Palaces were state-funded youth centers in the U.S.S.R. in which dedicated children were
trained in speciﬁc disciplines. These schools were famous for pumping out highly professionalized
young chess players. Most Pioneers’ Palaces were shut down with the fall of the Soviet Union.III. See the chapters Using Adversity in Part II of the book and Building Your Trigger in Part III.CHAPTER 6
THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL
Beginning when I was eighteen years old, I spent four years coaching a group
of talented young chess students at Public School 116 in New York City. The
class usually consisted of about ﬁfteen children, but the core of the team was
a group of six second-graders, all friends, all enthusiastic, spirited learners
whose rowdiness was offset by a passion for chess. I loved those kids. We had
wonderful times as I watched them grow, and eventually the team became
city champions, state champions, placed second in the kindergarten through
ﬁfth grade National Championship in 1999, and two of them won individual
national titles. I’m sure that over the years I learned as much from those kids
as they learned from me. There was something so refreshing in seeing their
innate, unsullied curiosity in contrast to the material ambition that moved
most of my older chess rivals.
One idea I taught was the importance of regaining presence and clarity of
mind after making a serious error. This is a hard lesson for all competitors
and performers. The ﬁrst mistake rarely proves disastrous, but the downward
spiral of the second, third, and fourth error creates a devastating chain
reaction. Any sports fan has seen professional football, basketball, and
baseball games won and lost because of a shift in psychological advantage.
People speak about momentum as if it were an entity of its own, an
unpredictable player on the ﬁeld, and from my own competitive experience, I
can vouch for it seeming that way. The key is to bring that player onto your
team by riding the psychological wave when it is behind you, and snapping
back into a fresh presence when your clarity of mind be gins to be swept away.
With young chess players, the downward spiral dominates competitive
lives. In game after game, beginners fall to pieces after making the ﬁrstmistake. With older, more accomplished players the mistakes are subtler, but
the pattern of error begetting error remains true and deadly. Imagine yourself
in the following situation:
You are a highly skilled chess Master in the middle of a critical
tournament game and you have a much better position. For the last three
hours you have been pressuring your opponent, increasing the tension,
pushing him closer to the edge, and searching for the decisive moment when
your advantage will be converted into a win. Then you make a subtle error
that allows your opponent to equalize the position. There is nothing wrong
with equality, but you have developed a powerful emotional attachment to
being in control of the game. Your heart starts to pound because of the
disconcerting chasm between what was and w hat is.
Chess players are constantly calculating variations and either accepting or
dismissing them based on a comparison of how they evaluate the visualized
position vs. the original position. So if you have an advantage, make an error,
and then still cling to the notion that you have an advantage, then when you
calculate a variation that looks equal, you will reject that line of thought
because you incorrectly believe it is moving you in the wrong direction.
Wha t results is a downward spiral where the founde ring player rejects
variations he should accept, pushing, with hollow overconﬁde nce, for more
than there is. At a high level, pressing for wins in equal positions often
results in losing.
As a competitor I’ve come to unde rstand that the distance between
winning and losing is minute, and, moreover, that there are ways to steal
wins from the maw of defeat. All great performers have learned this lesson.
Top-rate actors often miss a line but improvise their way back on track. The
audience rarely notices because of the perfect ease with which the performer
glides from troubled waters into the tranquility of the script. Even more
impressively, the truly great ones can make the moment work for them,
heightening performance with improvisations that shine with immediacy and
life. Musicians, actors, athletes, philosophers, scientists, writers unde rstand
that brilliant creations are often born of small errors. Problems set in if the
performer has a brittle dependence on the safety of absolute perfection or
duplication. Then an error triggers fear, detachment, uncertainty, or
confusion that muddies the decision-making pr ocess.I often told my wonderful young students to beware of the downward
spiral. I taught them that being present at critical moments of competitions
can turn losses into wins, and I conveyed strategies for how to do this.
Sometimes all the kids needed was to take two or three deep breaths or splash
cold water on their faces to snap out of bad states of mind. Other times, more
dramatic actions were called for—if I felt dull during a difﬁcult struggle, I
would occasionally leave the playing hall and sprint ﬁfty yards outside. This
may have seemed strange to spectators, but it served as a complete
physiological ﬂushing, and I returned, albeit a bit sweaty, in a brand-new
state of mind.
As an eighteen-year-old, I had not yet reﬁned my methodology for
snapping into pure presence—this system is the subject of the chapter,
Building Your Trigger, in Part III—but  I unde rstood that avoiding the ripple
effect of compounding errors had broad application. Then something
happened in my life that drove this rule into my soul.
It was my habit to walk the two miles to P.S. 116 every Wednesday,
planning my class and enjoying the city. One fall afternoon I was strolling
east along 33rd Street, lost in thought and headed toward the school.
Everyone who has grown up in Manhattan knows that it is important to look
both ways before crossing the street. Cars run lights and bicyclists ride the
wrong way down one-way streets. Drivers are used to narrowly avoiding
bustling midtown crowds, and most New Yorkers are untroubled by the
cacophony of sirens, blaring horns, and taxis speeding ten inches in front of
our noses. Things usually ﬂow nicely, but the margin for error is slim.
There I stood, within the maelstrom of the midtown rush, waiting for the
light and thinking about the ideas that I would soon be discussing with my
students. A pretty young woman stood a few feet away from me, wearing
headpho nes and moving to the music. I noticed her because I could hear the
drumbeat. She wore a grey knee-length skirt, a black sweater, and the typical
Manhattan ofﬁce worker’s white sneakers for the trek home. Sudde nly she
stepped right into the oncoming trafﬁc. I guess she was confused by the
chaotic one-way street, because I remember her looking the wrong way down
Broadway. Immediately, as she stepped forward, looking right, a bicycle bore
down on her from the left. The biker lurched away at the last second and gave
her a solid but harmless bump. In my memory, time stops right here. This
was the critical moment in the woman’s life. She could have walked awayunscathed if she had just stepped back onto the pavement, but instead she
turned and cursed the fast-pedaling bi cyclist.
I can see her now, standing with her back to the trafﬁc on 33rd and
Broadway, screaming at the now-distant biker who had just performed a
miracle to avoid smashing into her. The image is frozen in my mind. A
taxicab was the next to speed around the corner. The woman was struck from
behind and sent reeling ten feet into the air. She smashed into a lamppost and
was knocked out and bleeding badly. The ambulance and police came and
eventually I moved on to P.S. 116, ho ping that she would survive.
As I walked into the school, dumbstruck by the severity of what I had just
witnessed, I felt compelled to share a version of the story with my students. I
left out the gravity of her injuries but I linked life and chess in a way that
appeared to move them—this tragedy needn’t have happened. I explained
how this woman’s ﬁrst mistake was looking the wrong way and stepping into
the street in front of trafﬁc. Maybe wearing headpho nes put her in her own
world, a little removed from the immediacy of the moment. Then the biker
should have been a wake-up call. She wasn’t hurt, but instead of reacting with
alertness, she was spooked into anger, irritated that her quiet had been
shattered. Her reaction was a perfect parallel to the chess player’s downward
spiral—after making an error, it is so easy to cling to the emotional comfort
zone of what was, but there is also that unsettling sense that things have
changed for the worse. The clear thinker is sudde nly at war with himself and
ﬂow is lost. I have always visualized two lines moving parallel to one another
in space. One line is time, the other is our perception of the moment. I
showed my students these lines with my hands, moving through the air.
Whe n we are present to what is, we are right up front with the expansion of
time, but when we make a mistake and get frozen in what was, a layer of
detachment builds. Time goes on and we stop. Sudde nly we are living,
playing chess, crossing the street with our eyes closed in memory. And then
comes the taxicab. That chess lesson was surely the most emotional I’ve ever
taught.
Three years later, my students and I traveled to the National
Championships in Knoxville, Tennessee. The kids were now in ﬁfth grade and
one of the strongest teams in the country. In the ﬁnal round of the
tournament, we were tied for ﬁrst place. I waited outside the tournament
room with the parents of my kids. I always felt strange at a big game if Iwasn’t the one competing, but after years of teaching children and watching
them grow into dynamic competitors, it felt especially harrowing to sit and
wait for the verdict. Such experiences taught me that my father was not so
misguided when he insisted that watching was more stressful than
competing.
So I waited for my students to emerge, joyous or distraught. Out came Ian
Ferguson, a thoughtful boy with a wonderful introspective sensitivity and an
eccentric talent for the game. He had won his game and he ran over to me, we
high-ﬁved, and he said, “You know, Josh, I almost lost.” Ian had a giddy,
relieved expression on his face, but he also looked like he had seen a ghost. “I
made a big mistake and hung my bishop. My opponent laughe d and I got
really upset and reached for my queen. I was about to move but then I
remembered the woman and the bike!”
The move Ian was about to play would have lost his queen and the game,
but suddenly he remembered the lesson learned as a seven-year-old. He took a
few deep breaths to clear his mind, came back to the moment, collected
himself, and w on a critical game in the National Championships.CHAPTER 7
CHANGING VOICE
Whe n the ﬁlm Searching for Bobby Fischer came out I was sixteen years old and
winning everything in sight. I became America’s younge st International
Master that year, I won the U.S. Under 21 Championship twice at sixteen and
seventeen, and I came within a hair’s breadth of winning the World Under 18
Championship when I was seventeen. From the outside I may have looked
unbe atable, but inside I was a kid barely holding everything together.
While I adjusted to the glare of the media spotlight, my relationship to
chess was slowly becoming less organic. I found myself playing to live up to
Hollywood expectations instead of for love of the game. I understood the
danger of becoming distracted by the adulation and I fought to keep focused.
But I was slipping. M ore and m ore fans came to my tournaments to watch me
play and get autographs. Beautiful girls smiled and handed me their phone
numbers. Grandmasters smirked and tried to tear off my head. I was living in
two worlds, and I started having a peculiar sensation of detachment during
tournament games. Sometimes I seemed to play chess from across the room,
while watching m yself think.
Around the same time I began training with a Russian Grandmaster who
urged me to become more conservative stylistically. He was a lovely man—
literary, compassionate, funny —as human beings we connected but
chessically we didn’t gel. He was a systematic strategist with a passion for
slow, subtle maneuvering. I had always been a creative, attacking player who
loved the wild side of chess. I liked to live on the edge in the spirit of Bobby
Fischer and Garry Kasparov, and now my new coach had me immerse myself
in the opposite sensibility. We dove into the great prophylactic players,
studying the games of Tigran Petrosian and Anatoly Karpov, ex-worldchampions who seemed to breathe a different air. Instead of creating exciting
dynamics in their positions, these guys competed like Anacondas,
preempting every aggressive idea until opponents were paralyzed and gasping
for life.
While I found this work interesting, the effects of moving away from my
natural voice as a competitor were disturbing. Instead of following my
instincts, my coach urged me to ask myself, “Wha t would Karpov do here?”
But Karpov had cold blood and mine boiled. Whe n he searched for tiny
strategic advantages, I yearned for wild dynamics. As I tried to play in the
style that pleased my coach, chess began to feel alien. At times I felt as
though my head was in a thick cloud and I couldn’t see the variations. My
strengths as a young champion—c onsistency, competitive presence, focus,
drive, passion, creativity—were elusive and moving out of reach. I still loved
chess, but it no longer felt like an extension of my being.
Of course I was also at that moment when boys become men. While my
chess life was growing increasingly complex, I was thriving in my coming of
age. My last two years of high school were spent at the Professional Children’s
School, an exciting learning environment teeming with brilliant young
actors, dancers, musicians, a fencer, a young entrepreneur, a couple of
gymnasts, and now a chess player. Everyone at PCS was pursuing something
and many students were famous from movie careers or Broadway roles (talent
shows and school plays were absolute jaw-droppers). The school gave me more
ﬂexibility to catch up on my studies after traveling to distant tournaments,
and the education was ﬁrst rate—one creative writing class with a brilliant
woman named Shellie Sclan was the most inspiring academic experience of
my life.
I read Hemingway, Dostoevsky, Hesse, Camus, and Jack Kerouac. I went
out with girls and brooded about spending half my life entrenched over a
chessboard trying to will heart and soul out of sixty-four squares. Socially,
PCS allowed young celebrities to insulate themselves from staring fans,
because everyone was exceptional in one way or another. This was a
tremendous relief and I thrived at PCS; but in my professional life I felt
oppressed. The one-two punc h of a fame I wasn’t really prepared for and a
building sense of alienation from the art I loved had me hunge ring for escape.
Whe n I graduated from high school, I deferred my acceptance at ColumbiaUniversity and took off for Eastern Europe. I had fallen in love with a
Slovenian girl and de cided to spend some time on the road.
This was an intense, formative period of my life. As I matured into a
nineteen- and twenty-year-old young man, my relationship to chess was
infused with a more sophisticated consciousness. I was no longer soaring with
the momentum of my early career. Now I had my demons to wrestle with.
Self-doubt and alienation were part of my reality, but in Europe I was free of
the immense pressures of my celebrity back home.
I studied chess and literature and traveled the world with my notebook
and a rucksack. My home base was a little village called Vrholvje, nestled in
the mountains of southern Slovenia and overlooking northern Italy. I lived
romantically, took long walks in the woods, and dove deeper and deeper into
chess, sifting through the hidden nuances of nine rounds I had just played
against Grandmasters in Amsterdam, Crete, or Budapest. Then, after periods
of intense work, I would take off for another big tournament in some faraway
place.
During these years I discovered a powerful new private relationship to
chess. I worked on the game tirelessly, but was now moved less by ambition
than by a yearning for self-discovery. While my unde rstanding of the game
deepened, I continued to be uneven and, at times, self-defeating in
competition. I was consistently unha ppy before leaving for tournaments,
preferring my lifestyle of introspection and young romance. Whe n I dragged
myself off to tournaments, some days I would play brilliant chess and others I
would feel disconnected, like a poet without his muse. In order to make my
new knowledge manifest over the board, I had to ﬁgure out how to release
myself from the baggage I had acquired, and I developed a method of study
that made chess and life begin to merge in my being.
At this point in my career, despite my issues, I was still a strong chess
player competing against world-class rivals. Each tournament game was
riddled with intricate complications and hour upon hour of mounting
tension. My opponents and I created increasingly subtle problems for the
other to solve, building the pressure in the position until the chessboard and
the mind itself felt like a fault line, trembling, on the verge of explosion.
Sometimes technical superiority proved decisive, but more often somebody
cracked, as if a tiny weakness deep in the being sudde nly erupted onto the
board.These moments, where the technical and psychological collide, are where I
directed my study of the game. In the course of a nine-round chess
tournament, I’d arrive at around four or ﬁve critical positions that I didn’t
quite understand or in which I made an error. Immediately after each of my
games, I quickly entered the moves into my computer, noting my thought
process and how I felt emotionally at various stages of the battle. Then after
the tournament, armed with these fresh impressions, I went back to Vrholvje
and studied the critical moments.
This was the work that I referred to in the Introduction as numbers to leave
numbers. Usually long study sessions went like this: I began with the critical
position from one of my games, where my intuitive unde rstanding had not
been up to the challenge. At ﬁrst my mind was like a runne r on a cold winter
morning—s tiff, unha ppy about the coming jog, dreary. Then I began to
move, recalling my attacking ideas in the struggle and how nothing had fully
connected. I tried to pick apart my opponent’s position and discovered new
layers of his defensive resources, all the while my mind thawing, integrating
the evolving structural dynamics it had not quite unde rstood before. Over
time my blood started ﬂowing, sweat came, I settled into the rhythm of
analysis, soaked in countless patterns of evolving sophistication as I pored
over what a computer would consider billions of variations. Like a runne r in
stride, my thinking became unhindered, free-ﬂowing, faster and faster as I
lost myself in the position. Sometimes the study would take six hours in one
sitting, sometimes thirty hours over a week. I felt like I was living,
breathing, sleeping in that maze, and then, as if from nowhere, all the
complications dissolved and I unde rstood.
Whe n I looked at the critical position from my tournament game, what
had stumped me a few days or hours or weeks before now seemed perfectly
apparent. I saw the best move, felt the correct plan, unde rstood the evaluation
of the position. I couldn’t explain this new knowledge with variations or
words. It felt more elemental, like rippling water or a light breeze. My chess
intuition had deepened. This was the study of numbers to leave numbers.I
A fascinating offshoot of this method of analysis was that I began to see
connections between the leaps of chess unde rstanding and m y changing vision
of the world. During my study of the critical positions, I noted the feeling I
had during the actual chess game. I explained above how in the pressure of
tournaments, the tension in the mind mounts with the tension in theposition, and an error on the board usually parallels a psychological collapse
of sorts. Almost invariably, there was a consistent psychological strain to my
errors in a given tournament, and what I began to notice is that my problems
on the chessboard usually were manifesting themselves in my life outside of
chess.
For example, while living in Slovenia it appealed to my sense of adventure
to be on the road, traveling, writing, exploring new places, but I also missed
my family. I hardly ever spoke English, communicating with everyone but
my girlfriend (who did speak English) in broken Spanish, bad Italian, and
even worse Serbo-Croatian. I was a stranger in a strange land. On the other
hand, I felt quite at home in Vrholvje. I loved the charming village life, and
enjoyed my periods of introspection. But then every month or so I would
leave Slovenia and take off, alone, for Hunga ry, Germany, or Holland to
compete in a grueling two-week tournament. Each trip was an adventure, but
in the beginning I was invariably homesick. I missed my girlfriend. I missed
my family, I missed my friends, I missed everything. I felt like a leaf in the
wind, adrift, all alone. The ﬁrst few days were always rough but then I’d get
my bearings in the new city and have a wonderful time. I was just having
trouble with transitions.
It was amazing how clearly this manifested on the chessboard. For a period
of time, almost all my chess errors came in a moment immediately following
or preceding a big change. For example, if I was playing a positional chess
game, with complex maneuvering, long-term strategical planning, and
building tension, and sudde nly the struggle exploded into concrete tactics, I
would sometimes be slow to accommodate the new scenario. Or, if I was
playing a very tactical position that sudde nly transformed into an abstract
endga me, I would keep on calculating instead of taking a deep breath and
making long-term plans. I was having trouble with the ﬁrst major decision
following the departure from prepared opening analysis and I was not
keeping pace with sudde n shifts in momentum. My whole chess psychology
was about holding on to what was, because I was funda mentally homesick.
Whe n I ﬁnally noticed this connection, I tackled transitions in both chess and
life. In chess games, I would take some deep breaths and clear my mind when
the character of the struggle shifted. In life, I worked on embracing change
instead of ﬁghting it. With awareness and action, in both life and chess my
weakness was transformed into a strength.Once I recognized that deeply buried secrets in a competitor tend to
surface unde r intense pressure, my study of chess became a form of
psychoanalysis. I unearthed my subtlest foibles through chess, and the link
between my personal and artistic sides was unde niable. The psychological
theme could range from transitions to resilient concentration, ﬂuidity of
mind, control, leaps into the unknown, sitting with tension, the downward
spiral, being at peace with discomfort, giving into fatigue, emotional
turbulence, and invariably the chess moves paralleled the life moment.
Whe never I noticed a weakness, I took it on.
I also studied my opponents closely. Like myself, their psychological
nuances in life manifested over the board. I would watch a rival tapping his
feet impatiently while waiting for an elevator or carefully maneuvering
around his peas on a dinner plate. If someone was a controlling person who
liked to calculate everything out before acting, I would make the chess
position chaotic, beyond calculation, so he would have to make that
uncomfortable leap into the unkn own. If an opponent was intuitive, fast, and
hunge ring for abstract creations, I would make the position precise, so the
only solution lay in patient, mind-numbing m ath.
Whe n I was twenty-one years old and came back to America, I was more
in love with the study of chess than ever. The game had become endlessly
fascinating to me, and its implications stretched far beyond winning and
losing—I  was no longer primarily reﬁning the skill of playing chess, but was
discovering myself through chess. I saw the art as a movement closer and
closer to an unattainable truth, as if I were traveling through a tunne l that
continuously deepened and widened as I progressed. The more I knew about
the game, the more I realized how much there was to know. I emerged from
each good work session in slightly deeper awe of the mystery of chess, and
with a building sense of humility. Increasingly, I felt more tender about my
work than ﬁerce. Art was truly becoming for art’s sake.
Of course not everything was ﬁne and dandy. While personal growth had
been my focus in my life on the road, when I came back to America I was
back in the limelight. Fans once again mobbed me at tournaments, and I was
expected to perform—but  I was in one of those vulnerable stages of growth,
like the hermit crab between shells. While my new philosophical approach to
chess was exciting spiritually, it was also a bit unde rmining for a young
competitor. The youthful arrogance of believing I had the answers was gone. Iwas ﬂexible and introspective but lacked that unique character and drive to
my game that had made me a champion. As a lover and learner of chess, I was
ﬂying, but  as an artist and pe rformer I was all locked up.
I. It is important to understand that by numbers to leave numbers, or form to leave form, I am describing a
process in which technical information is integrated into what feels like natural intelligence.
Sometimes there will literally be numbers. Other times there will be principles, patterns, variations,
techniques, ideas. A good literal example of this process, one that does in fact involve numbers, is a
beginner’s very ﬁrst chess lesson. All chess players learn that the pieces have numerical equivalents—
bishops and knights are worth three pawns, a rook is ﬁve pawns, a queen is nine. Novices are
counting in their heads or on their ﬁngers before they make exchanges. In time, they will stop
counting. The pieces will achieve a more ﬂowing and integrated value system. They will move across
the board like ﬁelds of force. What was once seen mathematically is now felt intuitively.CHAPTER 8
BREAKING STALLIONS
I think a life of ambition is like existing on a balance beam. As a child, there
is no fear, no sense for the danger of falling. The beam feels wide and stable,
and natural playfulness allows for creative leaps and fast learning. You can
run around do ing somersaults and ﬂi ps, always testing yourself with a love for
discovery and new challenges. If you happen to fall off—no  problem, you just
get back on. But then, as you get older, you become more aware of the risk of
injury. You might crack your head or twist your knee. The beam is narrow
and you have to stay up there. Plunging off would be hum iliating.
While a child can make the beam a playground, high-stress performers
often transform the beam into a tightrope. Any slip becomes a crisis.
Sudde nly you have everything to lose, the rope is swaying above a crater of
ﬁre, increasingly dramatic acrobatics are expected of you but the air feels
thick with projectiles aimed to dislodge your balance. Wha t was once light
and inspiring can easily mutate into a nightmare.
A key component of high-level learning is cultivating a resilient awareness
that is the older, conscious embodiment of a child’s playful obliviousness. My
chess career ended with me teetering on a string above leaping ﬂames, and in
time, through a different medium, I rediscovered a relationship to ambition
and art that has allowed me the freedom to create like a child unde r world
championship pressure. This journey, from child back to child again, is at the
very core of my unde rstanding of success.
I believe that one of the most critical factors in the transition to becoming
a conscious high performer is the degree to which your relationship to your
pursuit stays in harmony with your unique disposition. There will inevitably
be times when we need to try new ideas, release our current knowledge totake in new information—but  it is critical to integrate this new information
in a manner that does not violate who we are. By taking away our natural
voice, we leave ourselves without a center of gravity to balance us as we
navigate the countless obstacles along our way. It might be interesting to
examine, with a bit more detail, how this happened to me.
*  *  *
Mark Dvoretsky and Yuri Razuvaev are the pillars of the Russian school of
chess. Considered by many to be the two greatest chess trainers in the world,
these two men have devoted their lives to carving talented young chess
masters into world-class competitors. They are both armed with an enormous
repertoire of original educational material for top-caliber players and you
would be hard-pressed to ﬁnd a Grandmaster out there who was not seriously
inﬂue nced by one of them. Between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one, I had
the opportunity to work extensively with both of these legendary coaches and
I believe the implications of their diametrically opposed pedagogical styles
are critical for students of all endeavors. They were certainly critical for me.
Whe n you meet Yuri Razuvaev, you feel calmed. He has the humble,
peaceful air of a Buddhi st monk and a sweet, slightly ironic smile. If making
a decision, for example about where to eat, he will shrug and gently imply
that both possibilities would ﬁnd him quite content. His langua ge is
similarly abstract. His mildest comments feel like natural koans, and in
conversation it is all too easy to let gems slip through your mind like a
breeze. Whe n the chessboard comes out, Razuvaev’s face settles into a relaxed
focus, his eyes become piercing, and a razor-sharp mind comes to bear.
Analyzing with Razuvaev, I consistently felt as though he was penetrating the
deepest wrinkles in my mind through my every chess move. After just a few
hours of work with him, I had the impression he unde rstood me more truly
than almost anybody in my life. It was like playing chess with Yoda.
Mark Dvoretsky is a very different type of personality. I believe he is the
most important author for chess professionals in the world. His books are
extensive training programs for world-class players and are studied
religiously by strong International Masters and Grandmasters. “Reading” a
Dvoretsky book takes many months of hard work, because they are so densely
packed with ideas about some of the more esoteric elements of serious chessthinking. It’s amazing how many hundr eds of hours I spent laboring my way
through Dvoretsky’s chapters, my brain pushed to the limit, emerging from
every study session utterly exhausted, but infused with a slightly more
nuanced unde rstanding of the outer reaches of chessic potential. On the page,
the man is a genius.
In life, Dvoretsky is a tall, heavyset man who wears thick glasses and
rarely showers or changes his clothes. He is socially awkward and when not
talking about or playing chess, he seems like a big ﬁsh ﬂopping on sand. I
met Dvoretsky at the ﬁrst Kasparov-Karpov World Championship match in
Moscow when I was seven years old, and we studied together sporadically
througho ut my teens. He would occasionally live in my family’s home for
four or ﬁve days at a time when he visited America. During these periods, it
seemed that every concern but chess was an intrusive irrelevance. Whe n we
were not studying, he would sit in his room, staring at chess positions on his
computer. At meals, he would mumble while dropping food on the ﬂoor, and
in conversation thick saliva collected at the corners of his mouth and often
shot out like streams of glue. If you have read Nabokov’s wonderful novel The
Defense, about the eccentric chess genius Luzhin—w ell, that is Dvoretsky.
Whe n seated at a chessboard, Dvoretsky comes to life. His thick ﬁnge rs
somehow manipulate the pieces with elegance. He is extremely conﬁde nt,
arrogant in fact. He is most at home across the table from a talented pupil,
and immediately begins setting up enormously complex chess compositions
for the student to solve. His repertoire of abstruse material seems limitless,
and it keeps on coming hour after hour in relentless interrogation. Dvoretsky
loves to watch gifted chess minds struggle with his problems. He basks in his
power while young champions are slowly drained of their audacious
creativity. As a student, I found these sessions to be resonant of Orwell’s
prison scenes in 1984,  where independently minded thinkers were ruthlessly
broken down unt il all that was left was a shell of a person.
Training with Yuri Razuvaev feels much more like a spiritual retreat than
an Orwellian nightmare. Razuvaev’s method depends upon a keen
appreciation for each student’s personality and chessic predispositions. Yuri
has an amazing psychological acumen, and his instructional style begins with
a close study of his student’s chess games. In remarkably short order, he
discovers the core of the player’s style and the obstructions that are blocking
pure self-expression. Then he devises an individualized training program thatsystematically deepens the student’s knowledge of chess while nurturing his
or her natural gifts.
Mark Dvoretsky, on the other hand, has created a comprehensive training
system that he believes all students should ﬁt into. His method when
working with a pupil is to break the student down rather brutally and then
stuff him or her into the cookie-cutter mold of his training system. In my
opinion this approach can have profoundly negative consequences for spirited
young s tudents.
During the critical period of my chess career following the release of the
ﬁlm Searching for Bobby Fischer, there was a disagreement about what direction
my study should take. On one side was Dvoretsky and his protégé, my full
time coach, who believed I should immerse myself in the study of
prophylaxis, the art of playing chess like an anaconda. Great prophylactic
players, like Karpov and Petrosian, seem to sense their opponent’s intention.
They systematically cinch down the pressure, squeezing every last breath of
life out of their prey while preventing any aggressive attempt before it even
begins to materialize. They are counterpunc hers by nature and they tend to
be quiet, calculating, rather introverted personalities. On the other side of
the argument was Yuri Razuvaev, who insisted that I should continue to
nurture my natural voice as a chess player. Razuvaev believed that I was a
gifted attacking player who should not be bullied away from my strengths.
There was no question that I needed to learn more about Karpov’s type of
chess to make the next steps in my development, but Razuvaev pointed out
that I could learn Karpov from Kasparov.
This was a delicate and rather mystical-feeling idea, and I wish I had
possessed the sophistication as a sixteen-year-old boy to see its power. On one
level, Razuvaev’s point was that the great attacking players all possess keen
unde rstanding of positional chess, and the way for someone like myself to
study high-level positional chess is to study the way the great players of my
nature have integrated this element of the art. An interesting parallel would
be to consider a lifetime rock guitarist who wants to learn about classical
music. Let’s say there are two possible guides for him in this educational
process. One is an esoteric classical composer who has never thought much of
the “vulgarity of rock and roll,” and another is a fellow rocker who fell in love
with classical music years ago and de cided to dedicate his life to this different
genre of music. The ex-rocker might touch a common nerve while thecomposer might feel like an alien. I needed to learn Karpov through a
musician whose blood boiled just like mine.
Razuvaev’s educational philosophy falls very much in line with Taoist
teachers who might say “learn this from that” or “learn the hard from the
soft.” In most everyday life experiences, there seems to be a tangible
connection between opposites. Consider how you may not realize how much
someone’s companionship means to you until they are gone—he artbreak can
give the greatest insight into the value of love. Think about how good a
healthy leg feels after an extended time on crutches—sickness is the most
potent ambassador for healthy living. Who  knows water like a man dying of
thirst? The human mind deﬁnes things in relation to one another—without
light the notion of darkness would be unintelligible
Along the same lines, I have found that if we feed the unconscious, it will
discover connections between what may appear to be disparate realities. The
path to artistic insight in one direction often involves deep study of another
—the intuition makes uncanny connections that lead to a crystallization of
fragmented notions. The great Abstract Expressionist painters and sculptors,
for example, came to their revolutionary ideas through precise realist
training. Jackson Pollock could draw like a camera, but instead he chose to
splatter paint in a wild manner that pulsed with emotion. He studied form to
leave form. And in his work, the absence of classical structure somehow
contains the essence of formal training—but  without its ritualized
limitations.
By extension, studying the greatest attacking chess games ever played, I
would inevitably gain a deep appreciation for defensive nuance. Every high-
level attacking chess creation emerges from a subtle building of forces that is
at the core of positional chess. Just as the yin-yang symbol possesses a kernel
of light in the dark, and of dark in the light, creative leaps are grounde d in a
technical founda tion. Years later, my martial arts training would integrate
this unde rstanding into my everyday work, but as a teenager I didn’t
unde rstand. I don’t think I was even present to the question.
TWO WAYS OF BREAKING A STALLION
Along with her many other impressive abilities, my mom, Bonnie Waitzkin,
trains horses. She used to compete as a hunter jumper and dressage rider, andas a young boy I often went with her to the barn in New Jersey and romped
around on the ponies. I could never believe the way she communicated with
the animals. If there was a problematic horse, people called my little mom,
who would walk up to an angry 1,700- pound stallion, speak in a soothing
voice, and soon enough t he horse would be in the palm of her hand.
Mom has a unique ability to communicate with all animals. I’ve seen her
hand-line ﬁve-hundred-pound blue marlin to the side of the boat, with barely
any strength. Angry, barking dogs quiet and lick her legs. Birds ﬂock to her.
She is a whisperer. She loves the animals and she speaks their natural body
langua ge.
Bonnie explains that there are two basic ways of taming a wild horse. One
is to tie it up and freak it out. Shake paper bags, rattle cans, drive it crazy
until it submits to any noise. Make it endure the humiliation of being
controlled by a rope and pole. Once it is partially submissive, you tack the
horse, get on top, spur it, show it who’s boss—the horse ﬁghts, bucks, twists,
turns, runs, but there is no escape. Finally the beast drops to its knees and
submits to being domesticated. The horse goes through pain, rage,
frustration, exhaustion, to near death . . . then it ﬁnally yields. This is the
method some like to call shock and awe.
Then there is the way of the horse whisperers. My mother explains, “Whe n
the horse is very young, a foal, we gentle it. The horse is always handled. You
pet it, feed it, groom it, stroke it, it gets used to you, likes you. You get on it
and there is no ﬁght, nothing to ﬁght.” So you guide the horse toward doing
what you want to do because he wants to do it. You synchronize desires, speak
the same langua ge. You don’t break the horse’s spirit. My mom goes on: “If
you walk straight toward a horse, it will look at you and probably run away.
You don’t have to oppose the horse in that way. Approach indirectly, without
confrontation. Even an adult horse can be gentled. Handle him nicely, make
your intention the horse’s intention.
“Then, when riding, both you and the horse want to maintain the harmony
you have established. If you want to move to the right, you move to the right
and so the horse naturally moves right to balance your weight.” Rider and
animal feel like one. They have established a bond that neither wants to
disrupt. And most critically, in this relationship between man and beast, the
horse has not been whitewashed. Whe n trained, he will bring his uniquecharacter to the table. The gorgeous, vibrant spirit is still ﬂowing in an
animal that used to run the plains.
*  *  *
Dvoretsky wanted to break me—shock and awe—and Razuvaev wanted to
bring out my natural shine. As it was, perhaps because of his own playing
style, my full-time coach was drawn to Dvoretsky’s conclusions—and so from
the age of sixteen a large part of my chess education involved distancing
myself from my natural talents and integrating this Karpovian brand of
chess. As a result, I lost my center of gravity as a competitor. I was told to ask
myself,“Wha t would Karpov play here?” and I stopped trusting my intuition
because it was not naturally Karpovian. Whe n the maelstrom surrounding
Searching for Bobby Fischer hit me, a big part of my struggle holding course
stemmed from my sense of alienation from my natural voice as an artist. I
lacked an inner compass.
Reﬂecting back on the last years of my chess career, more than anything
else I am struck by the complexity of the issues confronting an artist or
competitor on a long-term learning curve. It would be too easy to say that
one or two factors were decisive in pushing me away from chess. I could say
that the ﬁlm Searching for Bobby Fischer put too much pressure on my
shoulders. I could say that a bad teacher distanced me from my natural love
for the game. I could say that I discovered happiness elsewhere. But all this
would be too simple.
To my mind, the ﬁelds of learning and performance are an exploration of
greyness—of the in-between. There is the careful balance of pushing yourself
relentlessly, but not so hard that you melt down. Muscles and minds need to
stretch to grow, but if stretched too thin, they will snap. A competitor needs
to be process-oriented, always looking for stronger opponents to spur growth,
but it is also important to keep on winning enough to maintain conﬁde nce.
We have to release our current ideas to soak in new material, but not so much
that we lose touch with our unique natural talents. Vibrant, creative idealism
needs to be tempered by a practical, technical awareness.
Navigating our way to excellence is tricky. There are shoals on either side
of the narrow channel and in my chess career I ran into more than one. The
effects of moving away from my natural voice as a competitor wereparticularly devastating. B ut with the perspective of time, I unde rstand that I
was offered a rare opportunity to grow. Much of what I believe in today has
evolved from the brutal testing gr ound o f my ﬁnal years in chess.PART II
MY SECOND ART
CHAPTER 9
BEGINNER’S MIND
I ﬁrst picked up On the Road while ﬁnishing my preparation for the World
Under 18 Chess Championship in Szeged, Hunga ry, in the summer of 1994.
Jack Kerouac’s vision was like electricity in my veins. His ability to draw
sheer joy from the most munda ne experiences opened up the world to me. I
felt oppressed by the pressures of my career, but then I’d watch a leaf falling
or rain pelting the Hudson River, and I’d be in ecstasies about the raw beauty.
I was on ﬁre with a fresh passion for life when I traveled to Hunga ry.
Over the course of the two-week tournament, I played inspired chess.
Entering the ﬁnal round I was tied for ﬁrst place with the Russian champion,
Peter Svidler. He was an immensely powerful player and is now one of the top
Grandmasters in the world, but going into the game I was very conﬁde nt. He
must have felt that, because Svidler offered me a draw after just half an hour
of play. All I had to do was shake hands to share the world title—it was
unclear who would win on tie-breaks. Shake hands! But in my inimitable
leave-it-on-the-ﬁeld style that has won and lost me many a battle, I declined,
pushed for a win, and ended up l osing an absolute heartbreaker.
That night I took off across Eastern Europe to visit my girlfriend in a
resort village in Slovenia. She was the women’s chess champion of her country,
and was about to compete in a major tournament. A rucksack on my back, On
the Road in my lap, I took trains and buses and random car rides, digging it
all with a wired energy. I ended up in a little town called Ptuj, and will never
forget the sight of Kiti walking toward me on a long dirt road, wearing a red
sundress that moved with the breeze and seemed out of character, too soft. As
she came closer, her head tilted to the side; in her beauty was something
severe, distant, and a chill came over me.Our relationship was a rocky one, and we ended up ﬁghting for two days
straight until I left, exasperated, heartbroken, working my way back around
war-torn Croatia to Hunga ry so I could ﬂy home. I ﬁnished On the Road in the
middle of the Austrian night, sheets of rain pounding down on an old train as
it groaned into the darkness, a drunk Russian snoring across the car from me,
mixing with the laughs of gypsy children in the compartment next door. My
emotional state was bizarre. I had just lost the World Championship and the
love of my young life, and I hadn’t slept in six days, but I was more alive than
ever before.
Three weeks later, I was standing on a Brazilian street corner the day
before representing the U.S. in the World Under 21 Championships, and
sudde nly Kiti was in front of me, smiling, looking into my eyes. We laughe d
and our adventures continued. Such was my life.
After ﬁnishing On the Road, I began reading The Dharma Bums, Kerouac’s
fantastic story centering on the Beat Generation’s relationship to Zen
Buddhi sm. I believe this was my ﬁrst real exposure to a (albeit rather
eccentric) vision of Buddhi st thought. I loved the hedonistic internal
journeys and rebellious wisdom of Gary Snyder. I yearned to retreat into the
mountains and live with the birds. Instead I went to the Shambhala Center in
downtown Manhattan and studied meditation. I tried to chill myself out,
sitting cross legged on the ﬂoor, focusing on my breath. I had moments of
peace, but for the most part I was boiling with a hunge r to leave everything
behind.
That’s when I took off to live in Slovenia, and it was in my European
wanderings that I found the Tao Te Ching—a n ancient Chinese text of
naturalist musings, believed to be written by the hermetic sage Laotse (also
known as Lao Tsu) in the 6th century B.C.E. I described earlier how during
these years my relationship to chess became increasingly introspective and
decreasingly competitive. A large factor in this movement was my deepening
connection to Taoist philosophy.
Studying the Tao Te Ching, I felt like I was unearthing everything I sensed
but could not yet put into words. I yearned to “blunt my sharpness,” to
temper my ambitions and make a movement away from the material.I
Laotse’s focus was inward, on the unde rlying essence as opposed to the
external manifestations. The Tao Te Ching’s wisdom centers on releasing
obstructions to our natural insight, seeing false constructs for what they areand leaving them behind. This made sense to me aesthetically, as I was
already involved with my study of numbers to leave numbers. My unde rstanding
of learning was about searching for the ﬂow that lay at the heart of, and
transcended, the technical. The resonance of these ideas was exciting for me,
and turned out to be huge ly important later in my life. But for an eighteen-
year-old boy, more than anything the Tao Te Ching provided a framework to
help me sort out my complicated relationship to material ambition. It helped
me ﬁgur e out what was important apart from what we are told is important.
Whe n I returned to America after my time in Europe, I wanted to learn
more about the ideas of ancient China. In October 1998, I walked into
William C. C. Chen’s Tai Chi Chuan studio on the recommendation of a
family friend. Tai Chi is the meditative and martial embodiment of Taoist
philosophy, and William C. C. Chen is one of its greatest living masters. The
combination was irresistible.
*  *  *
I think what initially struck me that fall evening, when I watched my ﬁrst
Tai Chi class, was that the goal was not winning, but, simply, being. Each of
the twelve people on the dojo ﬂoor seemed to be listening to some quiet,
internal muse. The group moved together, slowly gliding through what
looked like an earthy dance. The teacher, William C. C. Chen, ﬂowed in front
of the students, leading the meditation. He was sixty-four years old but in
the moment he could have passed for anywhere between forty and eighty, one
of those ageless beings who puts out the energy of an ancient gorilla. He
moved dreamily, as if he were in a thick cloud. Watching Chen, I had the
impression that every ﬁber of his body was pulsing with some strange
electrical connection. His hand pushed through empty space like it was
feeling and drawing from the subtlest ripples in the air; profound, precise,
nothing extra. His grace was simplicity itself. I sat entranced. I had to learn
more.
The next day I went back to the school to take my ﬁrst class. I remember
that as I stepped onto the ﬂoor, my skin prickled with excitement. Everyone
was warming up, swaying around with their ﬁsts slapping into their lower
backs in what I would later learn was a Qigong exercise. I tried to follow but
my shoulders felt tight. Then Chen walked onto the ﬂoor and the room wassilent. He smiled gently as he found his place in front of the class. Then he
slowly closed his eyes while exhaling deeply, his mind moving inward,
everything settling into stillness, his whole body becoming m olten and live. I
was rapt. From the stillness, his palms ﬂoated up, the simplest movement
was profound from this man, and he began to lead us through the opening
postures of the Tai Chi form. I followed along as best I could. All the
profundity I was struck by in Chen’s form combined with a sense of total
befuddlement. His grace was a world away. I felt stiff and awkward.
After ten minutes Chen broke the class into groups and I was put with a
senior student who patiently described the basic principles of Tai Chi’s body
mechanics. As we repeated the ﬁrst few movements over and over, I was told
to release my hip joints, breathe into the lower abdomen, relax my shoulders
and back. Relax, relax, relax. I never knew I was so tense! After years of
hunc hing over a chessboard, my posture needed serious attention. The man
explained that my head should ﬂoat as though it were suspended by a string
from the crown point. This felt good.
Over the next few months, I learned the sixty basic movements of the
meditative form. I was a beginner, a child learning to crawl, and the world
began to lift off my shoulders. Chess was irrelevant on these wooden ﬂoors.
There were no television cameras, no fans, no suffocating pressure. I practiced
for hours every evening. Slowly but surely, the alien langua ge began to feel
natural, a part of me. My previous attempts at meditation had been
tumultuous—a ball of nerves chilling itself out. Now it was as if my insides
were being massaged while my mind ﬂoated happily through space. As I
consciously released the tension from one part of my body at a time, I
experienced a surprising sense of physical awareness. A subtle buzzing tickled
my ﬁnge rs. I played with that feeling, and realized that when deeply relaxed,
I could focus on any part of my body and become aware of a rich well of
sensation that had previously gone unno ticed. This was interesting.
From my ﬁrst days at the school, my interactions with William Chen were
stirring. His teaching style was unde rstated, his body a well of information.
He seemed to exist on another wavelength, tapped into a sublime reality that
he shared through osmosis. He spoke softly, moved deeply, taught those who
were ready to learn. Gems were afterthoughts, hidden beneath the breath, and
you could pick them up or not—he hardly seemed to care. I was amazed how
much of his subtle instruction went unno ticed.A beginner class usually had anywhere from three to twenty students,
depending on the day or the weather. My favorite sessions were rainy or
snowy weekday nights when most people chose to stay home. Then it was just
Chen and one or two die-hards, a private lesson. But more often there were
ten or so beginners in the room, working out their issues, trying to smooth
their movements. Master Chen would stand in front of a large mirror so he
could observe the students while leading the class. He would smile and make
some little quip about the current squabble between his son and da ughter. He
was very mortal. No fancy words. No spiritual claims. He didn’t expect the
bowing and scraping usually associated with Chinese martial arts—“If I can
do it, you can do it,” was his hum ble message.
Chen reminded me quite powerfully of Yuri Razuvaev, the Yoda-like
Russian chess teacher who had encouraged me to nurture my natural voice.
Chen had the same kind of insight into the student, although his wisdom was
very physical. I could be doing the form in class, feel a little off, and he
would look at me from across the room, tilt his head, and come over. Then he
would imitate my posture precisely, point to a leg or a spot on the lower back
where there was tension, and demonstrate with his body how to ease the
crimp. He was always right. Chen’s ability to mimic physical structure down
to the smallest detail was amazing. He read the body like a great chess player
reads the board. A huge  element of Tai Chi is releasing obstructions so the
body and mind can ﬂow smoothly together. If there is tension in one place,
the mind stops there, and the ﬂuidity is broken. Chen could always see where
my mind w as.
Over time, as we got to know each other, our interactions became
increasingly subtle. He would notice a small hitch in my form like a
psychological wrinkle buried deeply in my shoulder, and from across the
room, in a blink, he would look into my eyes, take on my structure, make a
small adjustment, and then fall back into his own body and move on with the
class. I would follow and immediately feel released, as if somebody had taken
a heavy knot out of my back. He might glance back to check if I had noticed,
he might not. If I was ready, I would learn. It was amazing how many
students would miss such rich moments because they were looking at
themselves in the mirror or impatiently checking the time. It took full
concentration to pick up each valuable lesson, so on many levels Tai Chi class
was an exercise in awareness. While this method worked very well for me, italso weeded out students who were not committed to serious practice. I’ve
seen many emerge bored from Chen’s most inspiring classes, because they
wanted to be spoonfed and di d not open their receptors to his subtleties.
A key movement at this stage of my Tai Chi learning experience was the
coordination of breath and mind. This relationship is a critical component of
Tai Chi Chuan and I think it’s important to take a moment to explain. Many
Chinese martial arts masters impose a forced, old-school breathing method
on their students. The idea is that a particular art has created a superior
method of breath control and this method should be followed religiously.
William Chen’s humble vision of this issue is that breathing should be
natural. Or, more accurately, breathing should be a return to what was natural
before we got stressed out by years of running around a hectic world and
internalizing ba d habits. I certainly had plenty of those.
In William Chen’s Tai Chi form, expansive (outward or upward)
movements occur with an in-breath, so the body and mind wake up, energize
into a shape. He gives the example of reaching out to shake the hand of
someone you are fond of, waking up after a restful sleep, or agreeing with
somebody’s idea. Usually, such positive moments are associated with an in-
breath—in the Tai Chi form, we “breathe into the ﬁnge rtips.” Then, with the
out-breath, the body releases, de-energizes, like the last exhalation before
falling asleep.
For a glimmer of this experience, hold your palms in front of you,
foreﬁnge rs a few inches apart, shoulders relaxed. Now breathe in while gently
expanding your ﬁnge rs, putting your mind on your middle ﬁnge rs,
foreﬁnge rs, and thumbs. Your breath and mind should both softly shoot to
the very tips of your ﬁnge rs. This inhalation is slow, gently pulling oxygen
into your dan tien (a spot believed to be the energetic center—located two and
a half inches below the navel) and then moving that energy from your dan
tien to your ﬁngers. Once your inhalation is complete, gently exhale. Release
your ﬁngers, let your mind fall asleep, relax your hip joints, let everything
sag into soft, quiet awareness. Once exhalation is complete, you reenergize.
Try that exercise for a few minutes and see how you feel.
In my experience, when these principles of breathing merge with the
movements of the Tai Chi form, practice becomes like the ebb and ﬂow of
water meeting a beach, the waves lapping against the sand (in-breath), then
the water trickling back out to sea (gentle, full exhalation). The energeticwave is what most people focus on, but the subtlety of the water’s return is
also deeply compelling.
It is Chen’s opinion that a large obstacle to a calm, healthy, present
existence is the constant interruption of our natural breathing patterns. A
thought or ringing phone or honking car interrupts an out-breath and so we
stop and begin to inhale. Then we have another thought and stop before
exhaling. The result is shallow breathing and deﬁcient ﬂushing of carbon
dioxide from our systems, so our cells never have as much pur e oxygen as they
could. Tai Chi meditation is, among other things, a haven of unimpaired
oxygenation.
Whe ther or not imperfect breath patterns or just plain stress was my
problem, my quality of life was greatly improved during my ﬁrst few months
of Tai Chi practice. It was remarkable how developing the ability to be
physically introspective changed my world. Aches and pains dissolved with
small postural tweaks. If I was stressed out, I did Tai Chi and was calmed.
Sudde nly I had an internal mechanism with which to deal with external
pressures.
On a deeper level, the practice had the effect of connecting disparate
elements of my being. My whole life I had been an athletic guy who practiced
a sport of the mind. As a boy I had been devoted to my love for chess, and my
passion was so unfettered that body and soul were united in the task. Later, as
I became alienated from chess, my physical instincts were working in
opposition to my mental training. I felt trapped in a cerebral bubbl e, like a
tiger in a cage. Now I was learning how to systematically put those elements
of my being back together. In early 1999, Master Chen invited me to begin
Push Hands practice. I had no idea that his quiet offer would change my life.
I. Tao Te Ching, chapter 4.CHAPTER 10
INVESTMENT IN LOSS
Whe n Chen asked me to start attending Push Hands classes, I was of two
minds. Up to this point, Tai Chi was a haven. My relationship to it was very
personal, and the meditative practice was doing w onders for my life. Stepping
into the martial side of the art, I feared, might defeat my purpose. I didn’t
feel like opposing anybody. I did quite enough of that on the chessboard. But
then, with more thought, it seemed like a natural progression: I was able to
stay relaxed when doing Tai Chi on my own, and now the challenge would be
to maintain and ultimately deepen that relaxation unde r increasing pressure.
Also, from what I had read, the essence of Tai Chi Chuan as a martial art is
not to clash with the opponent but to blend with his energy, yield to it, and
overcome with softness. This was enigmatic and interesting, a nd m aybe I’d be
able to apply it to the rest of my life. Enough s aid. I was in.
Whe n I walked into my ﬁrst Push Hands class, it was like entering a
different school. I was on the same wooden ﬂoor I had been coming to for
beginner classes for the past ﬁve months, but everything felt heightened.
New faces everywhere, a more martial atmosphere. Chen’s advanced students
ﬁltered througho ut the room stretching, working the heavy bag, meditating
with mysterious airs. I had no idea what to expect. William Chen walked to
the front of the class and we took about six minutes to move through the
form, a warm-up that precedes every Push Hands session at the school. Then
all the students paired up to begin practice. Master Chen walked over to me,
took my arm, and led me to a clear spot on the ﬂoor. He raised his wrist, and
motioned with his eyes for me to follow. We each stood with our right legs
forward, and the backs of our right wrists touching. He asked me to push
him.I pressed into his arm and chest but felt nothing at all. It was bizarre, like
hitting a soft void. He was gone and yet he was standing right there in front
of me with that same calm expression on his face. I tried again, and this time
the lack of resistance seemed to pull me forward. As I adjusted back he barely
moved and I went airborne. Interesting. We played a bit more. On a basic
level, the idea of Push Hands is to unba lance your opponent, and I tried to
apply my old basketball instincts to do so. This guy was sixty-four years old
and I was an athlete—shouldn’t be a problem. But Chen controlled me
without any effort at all. He was inside my skin and I felt like I was doing a
moon dance, ﬂoating around at his will, without any connection to the
ground. At times he felt immovable, like a brick wall, and then sudde nly his
body would dissolve into cloudlike emptiness. It was astonishing.
After a few minutes, Chen started to show me things. First, he pushed
gently on my hip, reminding me that in the Tai Chi form, sung kwa or a
relaxed hip joint is critical. Then he told me to push into his shoulder, and he
slowly laid out the body mechanics of his cloud-like transformation. If I
pushed into his right shoulder, his right palm ﬂoated up, barely touching my
wrist but subtly transferring the focal point away from his shoulder. There
was hardly any contact between us, but enough to feel potentially substantial,
luring me in. As my push continued, his shoulder dissolved away while the
imperceptible resistance from his wrist took its place. The key is that his
deﬂection of my power from his shoulder to his wrist was so subtle that it
didn’t register in my mind. I gradually overextended because I always felt on
the brink of connecting, and before I knew it I was way off balance and
stumbling in one direction or another. If I slowed down and tried to notice
my point of overextension, then he followed my attempts at correction,
sticking to me like glue. Whe n the moment was just right, he’d add to my
momentum with a quiet, unde rstated expansion of his arm that deﬁed my
unde rstanding of how one generates force—it seemed to emerge from mind
more than body—and sudde nly I’d be ﬂying away from him. It was amazing
how much he could do with so little effort.
From my ﬂedgling moments of Push Hands, I was hooked. It was apparent
that the art was inﬁnitely subtle and packed with profound implications, and
I knew immediately that the process would be somewhat similar to learning
chess. But I had a long w ay to go.First things ﬁrst—I had to begin with an unde rstanding of the art’s
founda tion. The martial philosophy behind Push Hands, in the langua ge of
the Tai Chi Classics, is “to defeat a thousand pounds with four ounces.” Chen’s
barely perceptible contact between his wrist and my pushing hand was an
embodiment of the “four ounces,” but there are countless manifestations of
this principle inside and outside of Tai Chi—some physical, some
psychological. If aggression meets empty space it tends to defeat itself. I
guess the perfect image is Lucy snatching the football away time and again as
Charlie Brown tries to kick it. Poor Charlie just keeps on ﬂipping himself
into the air. The Tai Chi practitioner’s body needs to learn how to react
quickly and naturally slip away from every conceivable strike. The problem is
that we are conditioned to tense up and resist incoming or hostile force, so we
have to learn an entirely new physiological response to aggression. Before
learning the body mechanics of nonresistance, I had to unlearn my current
physical paradigm. Easier said than done.
Try this: Stand up and plant your feet in the ground. Really dig in.
Imagine you are on the edge of a cliff. Now ask a friend or sibling or spouse
to push into you, and to keep following your attempts at escape with the
intention of making your feet move. This can be done very gently. Both of you
should move slowly and smoothly to avoid injury. My guess is that your physical
instinct is to push back, brace yourself, and try to hold your ground.
Now, you have read about the idea of nonresistance. Give it a try. Try to
maintain your stance without resisting at all and without moving faster than
your opponent. Odds are that unless you are a trained martial artist, this
notion feels unnatural. Whe re are you suppo sed to go? You might try to
retreat into your rear leg, but if your partner follows your retreat, you’ll run
out of space. At this point, you will resist. If your partner or opponent is
stronger than you or has good leverage or momentum built up, you will not
be able to stop the incoming po wer.
Fortunately, we don’t learn Push Hands while teetering on the edge of a
cliff. It is not a tragedy if we lose our balance. That said, one of the most
challenging leaps for Push Hands students is to release the ego enough to
allow themselves to be tossed around while they learn how not to resist. If a
big strong guy comes into a martial arts studio and someone pushes him, he
wants to resist and push the guy back to prove that he is a big strong guy.
The problem is that he isn’t learning anything by doing this. In order togrow, he needs to give up his current mind-set. He needs to lose to win. The
bruiser will need to get pushed around by little guys for a while, until he
learns how to use more than brawn. William Chen calls this investment in loss.
Investment in loss is giving yourself to the learning process. In Push Hands
it is letting yourself be pushed without reverting back to old habits—
training yourself to be soft and receptive when your body doesn’t have any
idea how to do it and w ants to tighten up.
The timing of my life was perfect for this type of process. I was wide open
to the idea of getting tossed around—P ush Hands class was humility
training. Working with Chen’s advanced students, I was thrown all over the
place. They were too fast for me, and their attacks felt like heat-seeking
missiles. Whe n I neutralized one foray, the next came from out of nowhere
and I went ﬂying. Chen watched these sessions, and made subtle corrections.
Every day, he taught me new Tai Chi principles and reﬁned my body
mechanics and technical unde rstanding. I felt like a soft piece of clay being
molded into shape.
As the weeks and months passed by, I devoted myself to training and made
rapid progress. Working with other beginners, I could quickly ﬁnd and
exploit the tension in their bodies and at times I was able to stay completely
relaxed while their attacks slipped by me. While I learned with open pores—
no ego in the way—it seemed that many other students were frozen in place,
repeating their errors over and over, unable to improve because of a fear of
releasing old habits. Whe n Chen made sugge stions, they would explain their
thinking in an attempt to justify themselves. They were locked up by the
need to be correct.
I have long believed that if a student of virtually any discipline could
avoid ever repeating the same mistake twice—bo th technical and
psychological—he  or she would skyrocket to the top of their ﬁeld. Of course
such a feat is impossible—we are bound to repeat thematic errors, if only
because many themes are elusive and difﬁcult to pinpoint. For example, in
my chess career I didn’t realize I was faltering in transitional moments until
many months of study brought the pattern to light. So the aim is to
minimize repetition as much as possible, by having an eye for consistent
psychological and technical themes of error.
In the last years of my chess career, I was numbed by a building sense of
alienation. Pressure messed up my head and I got stuck, like the guys doingPush Hands who don’t learn from their mistakes and practice with a
desperate need to win, to be right, to have everything unde r control. This
ultimately cripples growth and makes Tai Chi look like an extension of rush
hour in Times Square. In those early Tai Chi years, my mission was to be wide
open to every bit of information. I tried my best to learn from each error,
whether it was my own or that of a training partner. Each Push Hands class
was a revelation, and after a few months I could handle most players who had
been studying for a few years.
This was an exciting time. As I internalized Tai Chi’s technical founda tion,
I began to see my chess unde rstanding manifesting itself in the Push Hands
game. I was intimate with competition, so offbeat strategic dynamics were in
my blood. I would notice structural ﬂaws in someone’s posture, just as I
might pick apart a chess position, or I’d play with combinations in a manner
people were not familiar with. Pattern recognition was a strength of mine as
well, and I quickly picked up o n people’s tells.
As the months turned into years, my training became more and more
vigorous and I learned how to dissolve away from attacks while staying rooted
to the ground. It is a sublime feeling when your root kicks in, as if you are
not standing on the ground but anchored many feet deep into the earth. The
key is relaxed hip joints and spring-like body mechanics, so you can easily
receive force by coiling it down through your structure. Working on my root,
I began to feel like a tree, swaying in the wind up top, but deeply planted
down low. In time, I was also able to make my Tai Chi meditation practice
manifest in Push Hands play. Techniques that are hidden within the form
started to come out of me spontaneously in martial exchanges, and sometimes
partners would go ﬂying away from me without my consciously doing much
at all. This was trippy, but a natural consequence of systematic training.
I have mentioned how a large part of Tai Chi is releasing tension from
your body through the practice of the meditative form. This is effectively a
clearing of interference. Now, add in the coordination of breathing with the
movements of the form, and what you have is body and mind energizing into
action out of stillness. With practice, the stillness is increasingly profound
and the transition into motion can be quite explosive—this is where the
dynamic pushing or striking power of Tai Chi emerges: the radical change
from emptiness into fullness. When delivering force, the feeling inside the
body is of the ground connecting to your ﬁnge r tips, with nothing blockingthis communication. Highly skilled Tai Chi practitioners are incredibly fast,
ﬂuid, responsive—in a sense, the embodiment of Muhammad Ali’s “Float like
a butterﬂy, sting like a bee.”
While I was internalizing this information, I was also constantly training
with people who were far more advanced. They absolutely manhandled me.
There was one man—c all him Evan—w ho was the slightly out-of-control
powerhouse of the school. Evan was a six-foot-two, 200-pound second-degree
karate black belt, eight-year Aikido student, and eight-year student of Tai
Chi. Master Chen only let Evan push with people who could handle his
aggression without ﬂipping out, tensing, and getting hurt. But even then,
Evan often stirred up confrontations. Once he felt I was ready, Chen started
pairing m e up w ith Evan.
Talk about investing in loss! It is one thing to put your ego on hold, but
this was brutal. Evan would have me plastered up against a wall, my feet a
foot or two off the ground, before I even saw the attack coming. It is in the
spirit of Tai Chi training for more advanced students to stop when their
partner is off-balance. But Evan had a different style. He liked to put you on
the ground. Week after week, I would show up in class and get hammered by
Evan. No matter how I tried to neutralize his attacks, I just couldn’t do it.
He was too fast—ho w could I dodge what I couldn’t see? I knew I should
avoid tensing up, but when he came at me my whole body braced for impact.
I had no idea how to function from relaxation when a freight train was
leveling m e ﬁfty times a night. I felt like a punc hing ba g. Basically, I had two
options—I could either avoid Evan or get beat up e very class.
I spent many months getting smashed around by Evan, and admittedly it
was not easy to invest in loss when I was being pummeled against walls—
literally, the plaster was falling off in the corner of the school into which
Evan invited me every night. I’d limp home from practice, bruised and
wondering what had happened to my peaceful meditative haven. But then a
curious thing began to happen. First, as I got used to taking shots from Evan,
I stopped fearing the impact. My body built up resistance to getting
smashed, learned how to absorb blows, and I knew I could take what he had
to offer. Then as I became more relaxed unde r ﬁre, Evan seemed to slow down
in my mind. I noticed myself sensing his attack before it began. I learned
how to read his intention, and be out of the way before he pulled the trigger.
As I got better and better at neutralizing his attacks, I began to notice andexploit weaknesses in his game, and sometimes I found myself peacefully
watching hi s hands come toward me in slow motion.
There came a moment when the tables clearly turned for me and Evan. My
training had gotten very intense, I had won a couple of middleweight
National Championship titles, and was preparing for the World
Championships. Evan and I hadn’t worked together in a while because he
started avoiding me as I improved. But this evening Master Chen paired us
up on the mats. Evan came at me like a bull, and I instinctively avoided his
onslaught and threw him on the ﬂoor. He got up, came back at me, and I
tossed him again. I was shocked by how easy it felt. After a few minutes of
this Evan said that his foot was bothering him and he called it a night. We
shook hands, and he  would never work with me again.
Reﬂecting on our relationship, I don’t think there was ever any malice in
Evan’s actions. Truth be told, I think he is a good guy whose no-nonsense,
smashmouth approach to martial arts training presented me with a priceless
learning opportunity. It’s clear that if in the beginning I had needed to look
good to satisfy my ego, then I would have avoided that opportunity and all
the pain that accompanied it. For his part, Evan was big and strong, and to an
inexperienced martial artist he was terrifying, but his forceful approach held
him back from internalizing some of the more subtle elements of the art.
Most critically, Evan was unwilling to invest in loss himself. He could have
taken my improvement as a chance to raise his game, but instead he opted
out.
*  *  *
Thinking back on my competitive life, I realize how deﬁning these themes of
Beginner’s Mind and Investment in Loss have been. Periodically, I have had to
take apart my game and go through a rough patch. In all disciplines, there
are times when a performer is ready for action, and times when he or she is
soft, in ﬂux, broken-down or in a period of growth. Learners in this phase are
inevitably vulnerable. It is important to have perspective on this and allow
yourself protected periods for cultivation. A gifted boxer with a fabulous
right and no left will get beat up while he tries to learn the jab. Or take the
talented high school basketball player learning ho w to play point guard at the
college level. He may have been able to dominate schoolyards in his past, butnow he has to learn to see the whole court, share the ball, bring the best out
of his teammates. If a young athlete is expected to perform brilliantly in his
ﬁrst games within this new system, he will surely disappoint. He needs time
to internalize the new skills before he will improve. The same can be said
about a chess player adjusting to a new opening repertoire, a martial artist
learning a new technique, or a golfer, for example Tiger Woods, taking apart
his swing in order to make a long-term improvement.
How can we incorporate these ideas into the real world? In certain
competitive arenas—our working lives, for example—there are seldom weeks
in which performance does not matter. Similarly, it is not so difﬁcult to have
a beginner’s mind and to be willing to invest in loss when you are truly a
beginner, but it is much harder to maintain that humility and openness to
learning when people are watching and expecting you to perform. True
enough. This was a huge  problem for me in my chess career after the movie
came out. Psychologically, I didn’t give myself the room to invest in loss.
My response is that it is essential to have a liberating incremental approach
that allows for times when you are not in a peak performance state. We must
take responsibility for ourselves, and not expect the rest of the world to
unde rstand what it takes to become the best that we can become. Great ones
are willing to get burned time and again as they sharpen their swords in the
ﬁre. Consider Michael Jordan. It is common knowledge that Jordan made
more last-minute shots to win the game for his team than any other player in
the history of the NBA. Wha t is not so well known, is that Jordan also
missed more last-minute shots to lose the game for his team than any other
player in the history of the game. Wha t made him the greatest was not
perfection, but a willingne ss to put himself on the line as a way of life. Did
he suffer all those nights when he sent twenty thousand Bulls fans home
heartbroken? Of course. But he was willing to look bad on the road to
basketball immortality.CHAPTER 11
MAKING SMALLER CIRCLES
My search for the essential principles lying at the hearts of and connecting
chess, the martial arts, and in a broader sense the learning process, was
inspired to a certain extent by Robert Pirsig’s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance. I’ll never forget a scene that would guide my approach to
learning for years to come. The protagonist of Pirsig’s story, a brilliant if
eccentric man named Phaedrus, is teaching a rhetoric student who is all
jammed up when given the assignment to write a ﬁve-hundr ed-word story
about her town. She can’t write a word. The town seems so small, so
incidental—what could possibly be interesting enough to write about?
Phaedrus liberates the girl from her writer’s block by changing the
assignment. He asks her to write about the front of the opera house outside
her classroom on a small street in a small neighbo rhood of that same dull
town. She should begin with the uppe r-left hand brick. At ﬁrst the student is
incredulous, but then a torrent of creativity unleashes and she can’t stop
writing. T he next day she comes to class with twenty inspired pages.
I believe this little anecdote has the potential to distinguish success from
failure in the pursuit of excellence. The theme is depth over breadth. The
learning pr inciple is to plunge  into the detailed mystery of the micro in order
to unde rstand what makes the macro tick. Our obstacle is that we live in an
attention-deﬁcit culture. We are bombarded with more and m ore information
on television, radio, cell phones, video games, the Internet. The constant
supply of stimulus has the potential to turn us into addicts, always hunge ring
for something new and prefabricated to keep us entertained. Whe n nothing
exciting is going on, we might get bored, distracted, separated from the
moment. So we look for new entertainment, surf channels, ﬂip throughmagazines. If caught in these rhythms, we are like tiny current-bound surface
ﬁsh, ﬂoating along a two-dimensional world without any sense for the
gorgeous abyss below. Whe n these societally induc ed tendencies translate
into the learning pr ocess, they have devastating effect.
*  *  *
Let’s return to the martial arts. I think it is safe to say that many people
consciously or unconsciously associate the term martial art with legend and
ﬁlm. We think of ninjas passing invisibly through the night, or shrouded
heroes running up walls and ﬂying through the air in Crouching Tiger Hidden
Dragon. We see wild leaping Van Damme kicks and Jackie Chan ﬂips. We
watch completely unrealistic choreography, ﬁlmed with sophisticated aerial
wires and raucous special effects, and some of us come away wanting to do
that stuff too. This leads to the most common error in the learning of martial
arts: to take on too much at once. Many “Kung Fu” schools fuel this problem
by teaching numerous ﬂowery forms, choreographed sets of movement, and
students are rated by how many forms they know. Everyone races to learn
more and more, but nothing is done deeply. Things look pretty but they are
superﬁcial, without a sound body mechanic or principled founda tion.
Nothing is learned at a high level and what results are form collectors with
fancy kicks and twirls that have absolutely no martial value.
I had a different approach. From very early on, I felt that the moving
meditation of Tai Chi Chuan has the primary martial purpose of allowing
practitioners to reﬁne certain fundamental principles.I Many of them can be
explored by standing up, taking a stance, and incrementally reﬁning the
simplest of movements—for example pushing your hands six inches through
the air. With the practice of this type of simpliﬁed motion you can feel the
subtlest ripples inside the body. You become aware of all the tension that
resides in your feet, legs, back, and shoulders. Then you release the tension,
step by step, hour by hour, month by month, and with the fading of tension
comes a whole new world of sensation. You learn to direct your awareness
inside the body, and soon enough your ﬁnge rs come alive with tingling, you
feel heat surging up your back and through your arms. The Tai Chi system
can be seen as a comprehensive laboratory for internalizing good
funda mentals, releasing tension, and cultivating energetic awareness.I practiced the Tai Chi meditative form diligently, many hours a day. At
times I repeated segments of the form over and over, honing certain
techniques while reﬁning my body mechanics and deepening my sense of
relaxation. I focused on small movements, sometimes spending hours moving
my hand out a few inches, then releasing it back, energizing outwards,
connecting my feet to my ﬁnge rtips with less and less obstruction. Practicing
in this manner, I was able to sharpen my feeling for Tai Chi. When through
painstaking reﬁnement of a small movement I had the improved feeling, I
could translate it onto other parts of the form, and sudde nly everything
would start ﬂowing at a higher level. The key was to recognize that the
principles making one simple technique tick were the same fundamentals
that fueled the whole expansive system of Tai Chi Chuan.
This method is similar to my early study of chess, where I explored
endga me positions of reduced complexity—for example king and pawn
against king, only three pieces on the board—in order to touch high-level
principles such as the power of empty space, zugzwang (where any move of the
opponent will destroy his position), tempo, or structural planning. Once I
experienced these principles, I could apply them to complex positions
because they were in my mental framework. However, if you study
complicated chess openings and middlegames right off the bat, it is difﬁcult
to think in an abstract axiomatic langua ge because all your energies are
preoccupied with not blunde ring. It would be absurd to try to teach a new
ﬁgure skater the principle of relaxation on the ice by launching straight into
triple axels. She should begin with the funda mentals of gliding along the ice,
turning, and skating backwards with deepening relaxation. Then, step by
step, more and more complicated maneuvers can be absorbed, while she
maintains the sense of ease that was initially experienced within the simplest
skill set.
So, in my Tai Chi work I savored the nuance of small morsels. The lone
form I studied was William Chen’s, and I took it on piece by piece, gradually
soaking its principles into my skin. Every day I did this subtle work at home
and then tested it in class at night. It was easy to see whether something
worked or not, because training with advanced players like Evan usually
involved one of us getting smashed into the wall. In these intense sparring
sessions, showy moves didn’t work. There was no margin for idealized
fanciness. Things happened too quickly. It soon became clear that the nextstep of my growth would involve making my existing repertoire more potent.
It was time to take my new feeling and put  it to action.
*  *  *
Whe n skilled martial artists face off, it is very different from choreographed
Hollywood ﬁght scenes. High-level practitioners rarely overextend, and they
know how to read incoming attacks. Large fancy movements like cinematic
spinning back-kicks usually don’t work. They are too telegraphed and take
too long to reach the target. A boxing jab is much more effective because it
covers little distance, it’s quick, and it’s funda mentally sound.
A critical challenge for all practical martial artists is to make their diverse
techniques take on the efﬁciency of the jab. Whe n I watched William Chen
spar, he was incredibly unde rstated and exuded shocking power. While some
are content to call such abilities chi and stand in awe, I wanted to unde rstand
what was going on. The next phase of my martial growth would involve
turning the large into the small. My unde rstanding of this process, in the
spirit of my numbers to leave numbers method of chess study, is to touch the
essence (for example, highly reﬁned and deeply internalized body mechanics
or feeling) of a technique, and then to incrementally condense the external
manifestation of the technique while keeping true to its essence. Over time
expansiveness decreases while potency increases. I call this method “Making
Smaller Circles.”
Let’s combine Pirsig’s Brick with my concept of Making Smaller Circles and
see how they work. Let’s say that I am cultivating a certain martial technique
—for a simple example, a classic straight punc h. I stand with my left leg
forward, my hands up by  my head to protect my face. The jab is a short punc h
coming from the left, forward hand. The straight is the power punc h coming
from the ground, generating through my left foot, and moving through my
left leg, torso, diagonally across and up to the right side of my back, through
the shoulder, tricep, and ﬁnally delivered by the second and third knuc kles of
my right hand. First, I practice the motion over and over in slow motion. We
have to be able to do something slowly before we can have any hope of doing
it correctly with speed. I release my left hip, wind up, and spring the right
hand into motion as my left foot and hip joint spin my waist and uppe r body
into action.Initially I’ll have tension in my shoulder or back, but then I’ll sooth it
away, slowly repeating the movement until the correct body mechanics are in
my skin. Over time, I’m not thinking about the path from foot to ﬁst, I’m
just feeling the ground connecting to my ﬁnge rtips, as if my body is a
conduit for the electrical impulse of a punc h. Then I start speeding things up,
winding up and delivering, over and over. Eventually I start using a heavy
bag, practicing these body mechanics with increasing power, building
resistance in my body so I can deliver more and more force without hurting
myself. My coiling gets stronger and sometimes I hit the bag with a
surprising pop. A dangerous moment. Whe n hitting something instead of
moving through empty space, I might start to get excited and throw my
shoulder into the punc h. This is a classic error. It breaks my structure and
destroys the connection from foot to ﬁnge rtip—m any boxers make this
mistake and come away with shoulder injuries. I want to punch without
punc hing. No intention. My teacher William Chen sometimes teaches
punc hing by telling students to pour a cup of tea. It’s a beautiful thing.
Pouring tea creates the perfect punc h, because people’s minds don’t get in the
way.
Okay, so now weeks and months (maybe years) pass with the cultivation of
the right straight punc h. I know how to wind up properly. Whe n I hit the
bag, nothing hurts, there are no breaks in my structure. It feels as if the
ground is smashing the bag through my ﬁst, and my body mechanics are
smooth and relaxed. I’ve also built up quite a bit of power from all the work
with winding up, coiling, and releasing the body into motion. Whe n
throwing my right, I don’t think about anything technical anymore, my body
just knows the right feeling and does it. No mind. It’s in the blood. I’ve
learned how to throw a straight right. But not really.
The thing is, unless they are ﬂustered or caught in an awkward moment, a
good ﬁghter is rarely going to get caught with a big ol’ long wound-up
straight punc h. It’s just too obvious. This is where Making Smaller Circles
comes into play. By now the body mechanics of the punc h have been
condensed in my mind to a feeling. I don’t need to hear or see any effect—my
body knows when it is operating correctly by an internal sense of harmony. A
parallel would be a trained singer who, through years of practice, knows what
the notes feel like vibrating inside. Then she is giving a concert in a big
venue and the sound system is a nightmare. From onstage, she can’t hearherself at all—a surprisingly common occurrence. The great performer can
deliver a virtuoso performance without hearing a thing, because she knows
how the notes should feel coming out, even if her primary monitor—he r ears
—are temporarily unavailable.
So I know what a properly delivered straight right feels like. Now I begin
to slowly, incrementally, condense my movements while maintaining that
feeling. Instead of a big wind-up in the hips, I coil a little less, and then I
release the punc h. While initially I may have thrown my straight from next
to my ear, now I gradually inch my hand out, starting the punc h from closer
and closer to the target—and I don’t lose power! The key is to take small
steps, so the body can barely feel the condensing practice. Each little
reﬁnement is monitored by the feeling of the punc h, which I gained from
months or years of training with the large, traditional motion. Slowly but
surely, my body mechanics get more and more potent. My waist needs little
movement to generate speed. My hand can barely move and still deliver a
powerful blow. Eventually I can deliver a straight punc h that looks nothing
like a straight punc h. If you’ve ever watched some of the most explosive
hitters in the boxing world, for instance Mike Tyson or Muhammad Ali,
you’ve seen ﬁghts where knockouts look completely unrealistic. Sometimes
you have to watch in slow motion, over and over, to see any punc h at all. They
have condensed large circles into very small ones, and made their skills
virtually invisible to the untrained eye.
The chessic manifestations of this phenomenon are quite interesting. For
example, arguably the most funda mental chess principle is central control. At
all levels of play, the competitor who dominates the middle of the chessboard
will usually have an advantage because from this placement his or her pieces
can inﬂuence the entire battle. Curiously, if you study the games of some very
strong Grandmasters, they seem to completely disregard this principle. The
British star Michael Adams might be the clearest case in point. His pieces are
often on the ﬂanks and he appears to casually give opponents central
dominance—and yet he wins. The secret behind this style of play is a
profound internalization of the principles behind central domination.
Michael Adams knows how to control the center without appearing to have
anything to do with the center. He has made the circles so small, even
Grandmasters cannot see them.*  *  *
This concept of Making Smaller Circles has been a critical component of my
learning process in chess and the martial arts. In both ﬁelds, players tend to
get attached to fancy techniques and fail to recognize that subtle
internalization and reﬁnement is much more important than the quantity of
what is learned. I think it was this unde rstanding that won me my ﬁrst Push
Hands National Championship in November 2000, after just two years of Tai
Chi study. Surely many of my opponents knew more about Tai Chi than I did,
but I was very good at what I did know. I had condensed my body mechanics
into a potent state, while most of my opponents had large, elegant, and
relatively impractical repertoires. The fact is that when there is intense
competition, those who succeed have slightly more honed skills than the rest.
It is rarely a mysterious technique that drives us to the top, but rather a
profound mastery of what may well be a basic skill set. Depth beats breadth
any day of the week, because it opens a channel for the intangible,
unconscious, creative components of our hidden potential.
I. For example: shifting weight by releasing the hip joints; ever-deepening relaxation; the coordination
of mind, breath, and body; awareness of internal energies; winding up to deliver a strike; coiling
incoming force down into the ground; rooting; emptying one part of the body while energizing
another.CHAPTER 12
USING ADVERSITY
Super-Heavyweight Finals, Wong Fei Hung All Kung Fu Championships September 2001
A 230-pound giant glowered and raised his wrist to mine. His heavy sweating face
smelled of rage. This guy was an accomplished ﬁghter with a mean streak and lots of
friends at the tournament. He wanted to tear me apart. The referee stood frozen, poised
to set us loose for round two. I took a deep breath, exhaled, and felt the blood pumping
through my body, the ground soft beneath my feet.
In seven weeks I would defend my title as Tai Chi Chuan Push Hands
Middleweight U.S. Champion, and at 170 pounds I had entered the super
heavyweight division of a regional tournament for the extra training. Maybe it was
bad timing for an experiment, but I was curious to see how I could do against men
much bigger and stronger than myself.
In the ﬁrst round I had neutralized the big man’s strength, used it against him.
Now I had him mad, aggressive, and off balance. The ref gave the signal and my
opponent exploded into me, a brutal attack, coming fast from all angles but somehow
in slow motion when I relaxed into the moment. In Tai Chi the artist learns to turn
aggression back onto itself, but this is easier said than done when the incoming
violence is honed by decades of martial training. My shoulder slipped back when his
left hand ﬂew forward, his ﬁst ﬁlled the empty space, but then his right hand surged
toward my stomach. I melted away before the force connected, caught his right elbow,
and followed the momentum. Next thing I knew the guy was ﬂying away from me,
spinning twice in the air before righting himself eight feet away. He shook his head
and came back at me. Only a minute to go and I will have won the ﬁnals. He attacked
and I slipped aside, sensed I had him off balance, but then his shoulder ripped into me
and I heard a crack. My hand felt icy hot. I knew it was broken. The pain jolted meinto deeper focus. Time slowed to a near stop. I didn’t show him the injury, quietly
fought with one arm, fell into rhythm with his attacks. On the video his hands look
like bullets, but in the match they felt like clouds, gently rolling toward me, easily
dodged, neutralized, pulled into overextension, exploited. No thought, just presence,
pure ﬂow . . . l ike a chess game.
*  *  *
Whe n I think of this testing moment in my martial arts career, it reminds
me of that afternoon in India some years earlier when an earthqua ke spurred
me to revelation. In both cases, distraction was converted into fuel for high
performance. In the chess scene, the shaking jolted my mind into clarity and
I discovered the critical solution to the position. In the Push Hands moment,
my broken hand made time slow down in my mind and I was able to reach
the most heightened state of awareness of my life. In the chapter The Soft
Zone, I mentioned that there are three critical steps in a resilient performer’s
evolving relationship to chaotic situations. First, we have to learn to be at
peace with imperfection. I mentioned the image of a blade of grass bending
to hurricane-force winds in contrast to a brittle twig snapping unde r
pressure. Next, in our performance training, we learn to use that
imperfection to our advantage—for example thinking to the beat of the
music or using a shaking world as a catalyst for insight. The third step of this
process, as it pertains to performance psychology, is to learn to create ripples
in our consciousness, little jolts to spur us along, so we are constantly
inspired whether or not external conditions are inspiring. If it initially took
an earthqua ke or broken hand for me to gain clarity, I want to use that
experience as a new baseline for my everyday capabilities. In other words, now
that I have seen what real focus is all about, I want to get there all the time—
but I don’t want to have to break a bone whenever I want my mind to kick in
to its full potential. So a deep mastery of performance psychology involves
the internal creation of inspiring conditions. I will lay out my methodology
for systematically cultivating this ability in Part III. In this chapter, I will
take these three steps of high-performance training and illustrate how they
are also critical components of the long-term learning pr ocess.
*  *  *Let’s return to that intense scene in which my broken hand inspired a
moment of martial clarity. My perception became so heightened that I saw
everything in slow motion. My opponent seemed stuck in molasses while I
could move at full speed. The experience was very inspiring and ended up
being a beacon for my martial arts training for years to come. However, I
faced an immediate problem once the adrenaline faded. I was left with a
broken hand seven weeks before the National Championships.
I went to the doctor the day after the injury, hoping for some good news,
but after X-rays he told me there was no chance I could compete. I had a
spiral fracture in the fourth metacarpal. Best-case scenario, he said, my bone
would be fully healed in six weeks but my arm would have atrophied
substantially because I would be completely immobilized from the elbow
down. I would have just a few days for physical therapy, and it was absurd to
consider taking tournament-level impact unde r those conditions. I walked
out of his ofﬁce resolved to compete, and the day after I got my cast on I was
back in training.
My ﬁrst few days working with one hand, I felt a bit vulnerable. I was
worried about someone accidentally knocking into my cast and jolting the
injury. I held my right hand behind me, and mostly did sensitivity work with
training partners I trusted. We moved slowly, standing up, without throws,
doing classical Push Hands in which the two players try to feel each other’s
centers, neutralize attacks, and subtly unba lance the partner. This isn’t ego
clashing or direct martial work, but an important method of heightening
sensitivity to incoming power and intention—something akin to cooperative
martial meditation.
It is very important for athletes to do this kind of visualization work, in a
form appropriate to their discipline, but often when we are caught up in the
intense routine of training and competition, it feels like we have no time for
the internal stuff. I know this quite well. Sometimes when I am in the heat of
tournament preparation, months will pass with brutal sparring, constant
pain, hitting the mats hundr eds of times a night while drilling throws, and
then I’ll realize that I’ve moved a bit away from what really makes things
tick. Then I’ll spend a week doing soft, quiet work on timing, perception,
reading and controlling my opponent’s breath patterns and internal blinks,
subtle unba lancing touches that set up the dramatic throws that ultimately
steal the spotlight. After these periods of reﬂection, I’ll almost invariablyhave a leap in ability because my new physical skills are supercharged by
becoming integrated into my mental framework.
The importance of undul ating between external and internal (or concrete
and abstract; technical and intuitive) training applies to all disciplines, and
unfortunately the internal tends to be neglected. Most intelligent NFL
players, for example, use the off-season to look at their schemes more
abstractly, study tapes, break down aerial views of the ﬁeld, notice offensive
and defensive patterns. Then, during the season they sometimes fall into
tunne l vision, because the routine of constant pain requires every last bit of
reserves. I have heard quite a few NFL quarterbacks who had minor injuries
and were forced to sit out a game or two, speak of the injury as a valuable
opportunity to concentrate on the mental side of their games. Whe n they
return, they play at a higher level. In all athletic disciplines, it is the internal
work that makes the physical mat time click, but it is easy to lose touch with
this reality in the middle of the grind.
Since I had broken my right hand, I was forced to cultivate my weaker
side. I quickly realized that there were certain martial movements that I
relied on my strong hand to cover, and now my left had to catch up so it
could do everything. Day by day, my left learned new skills, from deﬂecting
attacks to uprooting someone at unusual angles to eating with chopsticks.
After a couple weeks of slow work, my fractured right hand was a bit more
stable. I was used to protecting it behind me while playing with my left, and
I was also comfortable falling and rolling without touching the injury to the
ﬂoor, so I was able to mix it up a bit more. Then my teacher began pairing
me up with slightly more aggressive training partners who were less skilled
than me and not necessarily controlled. A couple of these guys really wanted
to prove something. I was a big ﬁsh at the school and now was their moment
to dominate me. They had two hands, I had one, and they intended to exploit
the advantage. Clearly, I had to approach these situations with openness to
being tossed around. If I wasn’t prepared to invest in loss, there would be no
way to do this work. That said, it was fascinating to see how my body reacted.
My left arm instinctively became like two arms, with my elbow neutralizing
my opponent’s right hand and my hand controlling his left arm. I had no idea
the body could work this way, and after a few days of this training, the notion
that I was playing at a disadvantage faded. I felt completely comfortable with
one hand against two, so long as I was a bit more skilled than my partner.This new perspective opened up a whole new vision of martial intercourse.
I realized that whenever I could control two of his limbs with one of mine, I
could easily use my unoccupied arm for free-pickings. Today, techniques
around this idea are a staple in my competitive martial style. If even for a
blink of an eye you can control two of the other guy’s limbs with one of yours,
either with angle or timing or some sort of clinch, then the opponent is in
grave danger. The free hand can take him apart. This principle applies to
nearly all contact sports: basketball, football, soccer, wrestling, hockey,
boxing, you name it. On the chessboard it is also relevant. Any moment that
one piece can control, inhibit, or tie down two or more pieces, a potentially
critical imbalance is created on the rest of the board. On a deeper level, this
principle can be applied psychologically whenever opposing forces clash.
Whe ther speaking of a corporate negotiation, a legal battle, or even war
itself, if the opponent is temporarily tied down qualitatively or energetically
more than you are expending to tie it down, you have a large advantage. The
key is to master the technical skills appropriate for applying this idea to your
area of focus.
I was familiar with this competitive principle from my chess days, but it
wasn’t until I was forced to train one-handed that I began to understand how
potently it could be applied to the martial arts. I would never have guessed
that I could control two hands with one in a freestyle exchange, but to be
honest, after three or four weeks I became so comfortable fending off both my
opponent’s hands with my left, that the idea of ultimately getting my right
hand back felt like an unfair luxury. This injury was becoming a tremendous
source of inspiration.
There was also an intriguing physical component of my recovery. I wanted
to compete in the Nationals, so bizarre though it may sound I resolved not to
atrophy. At this point in my life I was very involved in the subtle internal
dynamics of the body through Tai Chi meditation. I had an idea that I might
be able to keep my right side strong by intense visualization practice. My
method was as follows: I did a daily resistance workout routine on my left
side, and after every set I visualized the workout passing to the muscles on
the right. My arm was in a cast, so there was no actual motion possible—but
I could feel the energy ﬂowing into the unused muscles. I admit it was a shot
in the dark, but it worked. My whole body felt strong, and when the doctor
ﬁnally took off my cast he was stunne d. Four days before the Nationals an X-ray showed that my bone was fully healed, and I had hardly atrophied at all.
The doctor cleared me to compete. On Wednesday I did my ﬁrst weight
workout on my right side in seven weeks, on Friday I ﬂew to San Diego, and
on Saturday, slightly favoring my newly empowered left arm, I won the
Nationals.
*  *  *
One thing I have learned as a competitor is that there are clear distinctions
between what it takes to be decent, what it takes to be good, what it takes to
be great, and what it takes to be among the best. If your goal is to be
mediocre, then you have a considerable margin for error. You can get
depressed when ﬁred and mope around waiting for someone to call with a new
job offer. If you hurt your toe, you can take six weeks watching television and
eating potato chips. In line with that mind-set, most people think of injuries
as setbacks, something they have to recover from or deal with. From the
outside, for fans or spectators, an injured athlete is in purgatory, hovering in
an impotent state between competing and sitting on the bench. In my
martial arts life, every time I tweak my body, well-intended people like my
mother sugge st I take a few weeks off training. Wha t they don’t realize is
that if I were to stop training whenever something hurt, I would spend my
whole year on the couch. Almost without exception, I am back on the mats
the next day, ﬁguring out how to use my new situation to heighten elements
of my game. If I want to be the best, I have to take risks others would avoid,
always optimizing the learning potential of the moment and turning
adversity to my advantage. That said, there are times when the body needs to
heal, but those are ripe opportunities to deepen the mental, technical,
internal side of my game.
Whe n aiming for the top, your path requires an engaged, searching mind.
You have to make obstacles spur you to creative new angles in the learning
process. Let setbacks deepen your resolve. You should always come off an
injury or a loss better than when you went down. Another angle on this issue
is the unfortunate correlation for some between consistency and monotony. It
is all too easy to get caught up in the routines of our lives and to lose
creativity in the learning process. Even people who are completely devoted to
cultivating a certain discipline often fall into a mental rut, a disengagedlifestyle that implies excellence can be obtained by going through the
motions. We lose presence. Then an injury or some other kind of setback
throws a wrench into the gears. We are forced to get imaginative.
Ultimately we should learn how to use the lessons from this type of
experience without needing to get injured: a basketball player should play
lefty for a few months, to even out his game. A soccer player who favors his
right leg should not take a right-footed shot for an extended period of time.
If dirty opponents inspire a great competitor to raise his game, he should
learn to raise his game without relying on the ugly ruses of his opponents (see
Making Sandals, in Part III). Once we learn how to use adversity to our
advantage, we can manufacture the helpful growth opportunity without
actual danger or injury. I call this tool the internal solution—we can notice
external events that trigger helpful growth or performance opportunities, and
then internalize the effects of those events without their actually happening.
In this way, adversity becomes a tremendous source of creative inspiration.CHAPTER 13
SLOWING DOWN TIME
As a child I had a fear that I could never be a chess master because I wouldn’t
be able to ﬁt all the information into my mind. Sometimes after two hours of
a chess lesson, my teacher’s words seemed to go in one ear and out the other,
and I envisioned a brain ﬁlled to the brim. Whe re could I ever put so much
more? And if I did manage to cram everything in there, how would I be able
to sort through the stuff? Of course this type of childhood fear is a little silly
—skilled humans internalize large amounts of data—but  I was on to
something. O nce we reach a certain level of expertise at a given discipline and
our knowledge is expansive, the critical issue becomes: how is all this stuff
navigated and put to use? I believe the answers to this question are the
gateway to the most esoteric levels of elite performance.
Thinking back on the chapter Making Smaller Circles, it’s apparent that I
was focusing on the subtle, introspective cultivation of external skills. Now
let’s turn further inward, and explore what states of heightened perception
can be cultivated with proper training. Whe n I broke my hand in that Super-
Heavyweight Finals match, time slowed down in my mind—o r my
perception became so sharpened, so focused on the essential, that I processed
necessary information much more quickly than usual. I didn’t feel like I was
racing, however. Internally, the experience was profoundly calm with a razor’s
edge—the epitome of what I think qua lity presence should be all about.
Once my hand healed and the Nationals were over, the question on my
mind was: how can I make time slow down without breaking a limb?
Everyone has heard stories of women lifting cars off their children or of time
seeming to slow down during a car accident or a fall down the stairs. Clearly,
there is a survival mechanism that allows human beings to channel theirphysical and mental capacities to an astonishing degree of intensity in life-or-
death moments. But can we do this at will?
Whe n I started thinking about how I could consistently make my
perception of time be different from my opponents’, I realized that I had to
delve into the operating mechanism of intuition. I suspect we have all had
the experience of being stumped by something, eventually moving on to
something else, and then sudde nly knowing the answer to the initial
problem. Most of us have also had the experience of meeting someone and
having a powerfully good or bad feeling about them, without knowing why. I
have found that, even if a few times it has taken years to pan out, these
guiding instincts have been on the money. Along the same lines, in my chess
days, nearly all of my revelatory moments emerged from the unconscious. My
numbers to leave numbers approach to chess study was my way of having a
working relationship with the unconscious parts of my mind. I would take in
vast amounts of technical information that my brain somehow put together
into bursts of insight that felt more like music or wind than mathematical
combinations. Increasingly, I had the sense that the key to these leaps was
interconnectedness—some part of my being was harmonizing all my relevant
knowledge, making it gel into one potent eruption, and suddenly the
enigmatic was crystal-clear. But what was really happening?
The question of intuition is hotly debated among psychologists,
philosophers, and artists, and it has been a source of much research and
thought in my life. My grandmother, Stella Waitzkin, a boldly creative
Abstract Expressionist painter and sculptor, used to tell me that intuition
was the hand of God. Artists often refer to intuition as a muse. In the
introduction, I mentioned that one philosophy professor of mine at Columbia
University told me, rather proudly, that the very notion of intuition is
incoherent—it doesn’t exist. In my opinion, intuition is our most valuable
compass in this world. It is the bridge between the unconscious and the
conscious mind, and it is huge ly important to keep in touch with what makes
it tick. If we get so caught up in narcissistic academic literalism that we
dismiss intuition as nonexistent because we don’t fully unde rstand it, or if we
blithely consider the unconscious to be a piece of machinery that operates
mystically in a realm that we have no connection to, then we lose the rich
opportunity to have open communication with the wellspring of our
creativity.For much of this book I have described my vision of the road to mastery—
you start with the funda mentals, get a solid founda tion fueled by
unde rstanding the principles of your discipline, then you expand and reﬁne
your repertoire, guided by your individual predispositions, while keeping in
touch, however abstractly, with what you feel to be the essential core of the
art. What results is a network of deeply internalized, interconnected
knowledge that expands from a central, personal locus point. The question of
intuition relates to how that network is navigated and used as fuel for
creative insight. Let’s begin the plunge  into this issue with chess serving as a
metaphor for all disciplines.
The clearest way to approach this discussion is with the imagery of
chunking and carved neural pathways. Chunki ng relates to the mind’s ability to
assimilate large amounts of information into a cluster that is bound together
by certain patterns or principles particular to a given discipline. The initial
studies on this topic were, conveniently, performed on chess players who were
considered to be the clearest example of sophisticated unconscious pattern
integration. The Dutch psychologist Adriaan de Groot (1965)  and years later
the team of William Simon and Herbert Chase (1973)  put chess players of
varying skill levels in front of chess positions and then asked them to re-
create those positions on an adjacent empty board. The psychologists taped
and studied the eye patterns and timing of the players while they performed
the tasks.
The relevant conclusions were that stronger players had better memories
when the positions were taken out of the games of other strong players,
because they re-created the positions by taking parts of the board (say ﬁve or
six pieces) and chunki ng (merging) them in the mind by their
interrelationships. The stronger the player, the more sophisticated was his or
her ability to quickly discover connecting logical patterns between the pieces
(attack, defense, tension, pawn chains, etc.) and thus they had better chess
memories. On the other hand, when presented with random chess positions,
with no logical cohesiveness, the memories of the players seemed to level off.
In some cases the weaker players performed more effectively, because they
were accustomed to random situations while the stronger players were a bit
lost without “logic to the position.” So, in a nutshell, chunki ng relates to the
mind’s ability to take lots of information, ﬁnd a harmonizing/logicallyconsistent strain, and put it together into one mental ﬁle that can be accessed
as if it were a single piece of information.
By “carved neural pathways” I am referring to the process of creating
chunks  and the navigation system between chunks . I am not making a literal
physical description, so much as illustrating the way the brain operates. Let’s
say that I spend ﬁfteen years studying chess. During these thousands of hours,
my mind is effectively cutting paths through the dense jungle of chess. The
jungle analogy is a good one. Imagine how time-consuming it would be to
use a machete to cut your way through thick foliage. A few miles could take
days. Once the path is cleared, however, you could move quickly through the
clearing. If you were to make a road and ride a bike or other vehicle, the
transportation would get faster still.
Whe n confronted by a new chess position, initially I have to plod through
the variations. During this process, I discover organizing principles and new
patterns of movement. This new information gets systematized into a
network of chunks  that I can access with increasing ease as my navigational
function improves.
Now, let’s turn to the learning of chess and see how these functions really
operate. We will start with day one. The ﬁrst thing I have to do is to
internalize how the pieces move. I have to learn their values. I have to learn
how to coordinate them with one another. Early on, these steps might seem
complex. There is the pawn, the knight, the bishop, the rook, the queen, and
the king. Each piece is unique, with its own strengths and weaknesses. Each
time I look at a chess piece I have to remember what it is and how it moves.
Then I look at the next piece and try to remember how that one moves. There
are initially thirty-two pieces on a chessboard. To make a responsible chess
decision, I have to look at all those pieces and check for captures, quick
attacks, and other obvious possibilities. By the time I get to the third piece,
I’m already a bit overwhelmed. By the tenth piece I have a headache, have
already forgotten what I discovered about the ﬁrst nine pieces, and my
opponent is bored. At this point I will probably just make a move and
blunde r.
So let’s say that now, instead of launching from the standard starting
position, we begin on an empty board with just a king and a pawn against a
king. These are relatively simple pieces. I learn how they both move, and
then I play around with them for a while until I feel comfortable. Then, overtime, I learn about bishops in isolation, then kni ghts, rooks, and que ens. Soon
enough, the movements and values of the chess pieces are natural to me. I
don’t have to think about them consciously, but see their potential
simultaneously with the ﬁgurine itself. Chess pieces stop being hunks  of
wood or plastic, and begin to take on an energetic dimension. Whe re the
piece currently sits on a chessboard pales in comparison to the countless
vectors of potential ﬂying off in the mind. I see how each piece affects those
around it. Because the basic movements are natural to me, I can take in more
information and have a broader perspective of the board. Now when I look at
a chess position, I can see all the pieces at once. The network is coming
together.
Next I have to learn the principles of coordinating the pieces. I learn how
to place my arsenal most efﬁciently on the chessboard and I learn to read the
road signs that determine how to maximize a given soldier’s effectiveness in a
particular setting. These road signs are principles. Just as I initially had to
think about each chess piece individually, now I have to plod through the
principles in my brain to ﬁgure out which apply to the current position and
how. Over time, that process becomes increasingly natural to me, until I
eventually see the pieces and the appropriate principles in a blink. While an
intermediate player will learn how a bishop’s strength in the middlegame
depends on the central pawn structure, a slightly more advanced player will
just ﬂash his or her mind across the board and take in the bishop and the
critical structural components. The structure and the bishop are one. Neither
has any intrinsic value outside of its relation to the other, and they are
chunke d together in the mind.
This new integration of knowledge has a peculiar effect, because I begin to
realize that the initial maxims of piece value are far from ironclad. The pieces
gradually lose absolute identity. I learn that rooks and bishops work more
efﬁciently together than rooks and knights, but queens and knights tend to
have an edge over queens and bishops. Each piece’s power is purely relational,
depending upon such variables as pawn structure and surrounding forces. So
now when you look at a knight, you see its potential in the context of the
bishop a few squares away. Over time each chess principle loses rigidity, and
you get better and better at reading the subtle signs of qualitative relativity.
Soon enough, learning becomes unlearning. The stronger chess player is often
the one who is less attached to a dogmatic interpretation of the principles.This leads to a whole new layer of principles—those that consist of the
exceptions to the initial principles. Of course the next step is for those
counterintuitive signs to become internalized just as the initial movements
of the pieces were. The network of my chess knowledge now involves
principles, patterns, and chunks  of information, accessed through a whole
new set of navigational principles, patterns, and chunks  of information,
which are soon followed by another set of principles and chunks  designed to
assist in the interpretation of the last. Learning chess at this level becomes
sitting with paradox, being at peace with and navigating the tension of
competing truths, letting go  of any notion of solidity.
This is where things get interesting. We are at the moment when
psychology begins to transcend technique. Everyone at a high level has a huge
amount of chess unde rstanding, and much of what separates the great from
the very good is deep presence, relaxation of the conscious mind, which
allows the unconscious to ﬂow unhindered. This is a nuanced and largely
misunde rstood state of mind that when reﬁned involves a subtle reintegration
of the conscious mind into a free-ﬂowing unconscious process. The idea is to
shift the primary role from the conscious to the unconscious without blissing
out and losing the precision the conscious can provide.
For a physical analogy, consider your vision. Le t’s allow the conscious mind
to be represented by your area of visual focus, and your unconscious to be
your peripheral vision. Chances are you are sitting down reading this book.
Wha t you see is the book. Now if you relax your eyes and allow your
peripheral vision to take over, your visual awareness will take in much more,
you can see things that are well off to the side. Now, the next step is to
refocus on the book, while maintaining a peripheral awareness. This is a skill
that some martial artists cultivate for situations with multiple opponents or
other such unpredictable occasions. In a relaxed enough state of mind, you
can zoom in on something in front of you with great precision while
maintaining a very sharp awareness of your surroundings. Along these lines,
chess players must let the unconscious ﬂow while the conscious leads and
follows, sorting out details, putting things in order, making precise
mathematical calculations.
Most people would be surprised to discover that if you compare the
thought process of a Grandmaster to that of an expert (a much weaker, but
quite competent chess player), you will often ﬁnd that the Grandmasterconsciously looks at less, not more. That said, the chunks  of information that
have been put together in his mind allow him to see much more with much
less conscious thought. So he is looking at very little and seeing quite a lot.
This is the critical idea.I
Now, think of me, Josh, competing against a less reﬁned martial artist.
Let’s say I am in the process of instigating a throw that involves six technical
steps. My opponent will experience an indecipherable ﬂurry of action, while
for me the six external steps of the throw are just the outer rim of a huge
network of chunks . Our realities are very different. I am “seeing” much more
than he is seeing.
Consider one of my favorite judo techniques, a variation of a sacriﬁce
throw—or sutemi-waza. I am facing my opponent. My left hand holds his
right wrist or sleeve and my right hand holds his collar. The technique
involves the following steps: 1) I gently push forward with my right hand on
his chest, causing a reactive push back. Fo llowing the momentum of his push,
2) I simultaneously pull his right arm forward and across his body, slip my
left foot in front of his right foot, pull down with my right hand on his lapel,
and sit back while spinning a bit to my left. 3) His right foot is blocked so he
has to fall forward, which actually feels okay to him because he will
apparently land on top of me. As he starts to fall forward, however, my right
foot slips between his legs. 4) As he falls on top of me, I pull his right arm in
toward me and kick up against his left inner thigh with my right foot,
ﬂipping him over. 5) I roll, following his fall, and end up on top of him. 6) In
the transition at the end of this technique, I take his head in what is known as
a scarf hold, and trap his right arm in a submission lock.
The ﬁrst time someone has this rather counterintuitive throw done to
them, it will all be a blur—one fast vertiginous experience of being ﬂipped
onto the ﬂoor and landed on. I speak from experience. I ﬁrst saw the throw
when my close friend Ahmed sprung it on me in training a few years ago.
Ahmed is a six-foot-two, 200-pound powerhouse whose martial instincts
emerge from a very different place than mine. He is a near Olympic-caliber
sprinter, a professional dancer and musician, and a lifetime martial artist,
which involves an unde feated Muay Thai full-contact kickboxing record (15–
0) and tremendous Jeet Kun Do and karate training. I was pretty skilled in
Tai Chi Chuan (had recently won bronze in the World Championships), had
some judo experience, and at this time, Ahmed and I were both a little over ayear into our study of the grappling art Brazilian Jiu Jitsu with the mind-
blowing martial artist and teacher John Machado. Because of our different
backgrounds, training with Ahmed often led to creative eruptions. Whe n
such knowledge gaps exist, much of the battle involves surviving the
unexpected and bringing the game into a place where the neural pathways are
carved. Other times, it’s like running a gauntlet. Whe n the transition from
the familiar to the foreign takes place, it feels like the mind is ﬂying
downhill over fresh snow and sudde nly hits a patch of thick mud. As an
obvious rule, it is good to be the one ﬂying downhill while your opponent is
in the mud.
Ahmed and I were in the swirl of free-training, moving fast. I was on my
feet, then I was head over heels and on my back before my brain knew what to
make of the situation. I hadn’t been blindsided like this in quite some time. I
immediately asked Ahmed to break down the throw for me and soon enough I
saw that the blur involved ﬁve or six steps, the founda tion of which was a
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu sweep I had not really unde rstood. I decided that this was
a throw I wanted to cultivate at a very high level. I ﬁgured that if it could
catch me, it would catch other people. So I started practicing. First I worked
on each step slowly, over and over, reﬁning my timing and precision. Then I
put the whole thing together, repeating the movements hundr eds, eventually
thousands of times.
Today, this throw is my bread and butter. In time, each step of the
technique has expanded in my mind in more and more detail. The slightest
variations in the way my opponent responds to my ﬁrst push will lead to
numerous options in the way I will trigger into the throw. My pull on his
right wrist will involve twenty or thirty subtle details with which I will vary
my action based on his nuanced microresponses. As I sit back on the ground
and trip his right foot, my perception of the moment might involve thirty or
forty variations.
Recall that initially I experienced the whole throw as a blur, too fast to
decipher, and now we are talking about a tiny portion of the throw involving
many distinct moments. Whe n it felt like a blur, my conscious mind was
trying to make sense of unfamiliar terrain. Now my unconscious navigates a
huge  network of subtly programmed technical information, and my conscious
mind is free to focus on certain essential details that, because of theirsimplicity, I can see with tremendous precision, as if the blink in my
opponent’s eyes takes many seconds.
The key to this process is unde rstanding that the conscious mind, for all
its magniﬁcence, can only take in and work with a certain limited amount of
information in a unit of time—envision that capacity as one page on your
computer screen. If it is presented with a large amount of information, then
the font will have to be very small in order to ﬁt it all on the page. You will
not be able to see the details of the letters. But if that same tool (the
conscious mind) is used for a much smaller amount of information in the
same amount of time, then we can see every detail of each letter. Now time
feels slowed down.
Another way of unde rstanding this difference in perception is with the
analogy of a camera.II With practice I am making networks of chunks  and
paving more and more neural pathways, which effectively takes huge piles of
data and throws it over to my high-speed processor—the unconscious. Now
my conscious mind, focusing on less, seems to rev up its shutter speed from,
say, four frames per second to 300 or 400 frames per second. The key is to
unde rstand that my trained mind is not necessarily working much faster than
an untrained mind—i t is simply working more effectively, which means that
my conscious mind has less to deal with. Experientially, because I am looking
at less, there are, within the same unit of time, hundr eds of frames in my
mind, and maybe only a few for my opponent (whose conscious mind is
bogged down with much more data that has not yet been internalized as
unconsciously accessible). I can now operate in all those frames that he
doesn’t even see.
This is why profoundly reﬁned martial artists can sometimes appear
mystical to less skilled practitioners—they have trained themselves to
perceive and operate within segments of time that are too small to be
perceived by untrained minds.
Now, returning to the scene that initially inspired this movement of
thought in my life—do es this type of trained enhanced perception I’ve been
discussing come from the same place as those wild moments in life when
time slows down in the middle of a car crash or, in my case, when my hand
shattered in the ring? The answer is yes and no. The similarity is that a life-
or-death scenario kicks the human mind into a very narrow area of focus.
Time feels slowed down because we instinctively zero in on a tiny amount ofcritical information that our processor can then break down as if it is in a
huge  font. The trained version of this state of mind shares that tiny area of
conscious focus. The difference is that, in our disciplines of choice, we
cultivate this experience by converting all the other surrounding information
into unconsciously integrated data instead of ignoring it. There is a reason
the human mind rarely goes into that wild place of heightened perception: if
an untrained ﬁghter were to focus all his energy on his opponent’s breath
pattern or blinking eye, he would get punc hed in the face or thrown on the
ground. If whenever I crossed New York’s 33rd Street and Sixth Avenue, I
zoned in on some random car that wasn’t about to hit me, and I saw it passing
in slow motion, then there is a good chance that one of these days I’d get hit
by another car. In most situations, we need to be aware of what is happening
around us, and our processor is built to handle this responsibility. On the
other hand, armed with an unde rstanding of how intuition operates, we can
train ourselves to have remarkably potent perceptual and physical abilities in
our disciplines of focus. The key, of course, is practice.
I. A technical example of how this might function in chess is for a player to consider a pair of
opposing bishops on a semi-open chessboard. There is a huge amount of information which is
fundamental to deciphering the dynamics of those two bishops—that is, central pawn structure,
surrounding pieces, potential trades, possible transitions to closed or open games or to endgames of
varying pawn structures, initiative, king safety, principles of interpreting these principles, principles of
interpreting those interpretive principles, and so on. For the Grandmaster the list is very long. For the
expert, it is relatively short. But more importantly, the Grandmaster has a much more highly evolved
navigational system, so he can sort through his expansive network of bishop-related knowledge in a
ﬂash (he sees bishop and immediately processes all related information), while the expert has to labor
through a much smaller amount of data with much more effort. The Grandmaster looks at less and
sees more, because his unconscious skill set is much more highly evolved.
II. The brilliant neurologist Oliver Sacks has explored the imagery of shutter speed in an article for The
New Yorker and in other writings about the different perceptual patterns of his patients with
neurological diseases.CHAPTER 14
THE ILLUSION OF THE MYSTICAL
Early on in my study of the philosophical founda tion of Tai Chi, while
scouring through a book of old adages called the Tai Chi Classics, I came upon
a passage that intrigued me. In the 18th century Wang Tsung-yueh described
his practice by writing:
If the opponent’s movement is quick,
then qui ckly respond;
if his movement is slow,
then follow slowly.
Then the 19th century sage Wu Yu-hsiang built on Tsung-yueh’s words
with a typically abstract Chinese instructional conundr um:
If the opponent does not move, then I do not move.
At the opponent’s slightest move, I move ﬁrst.
The ﬁrst stanza is rather straightforward. It is about listening, being
sensitive to the adversary’s slightest tremble, and sticking to him. Adherence
is at the center of Tai Chi’s martial applicability. Basically those four lines are
about becoming a shadow. But the last idea stumped me. A shadow is an
effect, not a cause. How do you move before someone you are following? The
precision of my chess days made me uncomfortable accepting this abstraction
on faith. Wha t was it all about?
This question was like a Zen koan to me. I spent countless hours thinking
about it, trying to wrap my head around the idea and to embody it in PushHands training. While it’s true that many of the old-school Taoist images
should not be taken too literally, there is often a large kernel of experiential
truth behind descriptions such as this one. I knew from chess that a superior
artist could often get into the head of the opponent, mesmerize him with will
or strategic mastery, using what I playfully like to call Jedi Mind Tricks. As
far as I unde rstood, the keys to these moments were penetrating insight into
what makes the other tick and technical virtuosity that makes the discovery
and exploitation invisible to the opponent. On the other hand, Chinese
martial arts tend to focus more on energy than pattern recognition. My goal
was to ﬁnd a hybrid—e nergetic awareness, technical ﬂuidity, and keen
psychological perception. Chess meets Tai Chi Chuan.
In time, I have come to unde rstand those words, At the opponent’s slightest
move, I move ﬁrst, as pertaining to intention—reading and ultimately
controlling intention. The deepest form of adherence or shadowing involves a
switching of roles, where the follower becomes the followed in a relationship
in which time seems to twist in a tangle of minds—this is how the great Tai
Chi or Aikido artist guides the opponent into a black hole, or appears to
psychically impel the other to throw himself on the ground. But what is
really happening? Let’s build on the last few chapters and try to break it
down.
*  *  *
My experimentation with intentionality began during my early chess years.
I’m a bit embarrassed to admit that as a seven-year-old boy in scholastic chess
tournaments, I sometimes lured my young opponents into blunde ring by 1)
making a move that set a trap and then 2) immediately groaning and
slapping my head. This over-the-top display would usually inspire a careless
moment of overconﬁde nce followed by an eager capture of a poison pawn or
some other seductive bait. Not very subtle on my part, I agree. But as with
all skills, the most sophisticated techniques tend to have their founda tion in
the simplest of principles.
As I improved as a chess player and competitor, my opponents and I
developed increasingly complex unde rstandings of psychological tells. By the
time I was ten or eleven years old, a slap on the head would have been anabsurdly transparent display of trickery. But a little change in my breathing
pattern might alert a rival that I had just seen something I didn’t like.
I don’t have much of a natural poker face. I’m an outgoing guy and tend to
wear my heart on my sleeve. Instead of trying to change my personality, I
learned how to use it to my advantage. While some chess players spend a lot
of energy maintaining a stony front, I let opponents read my facial
expressions as I moved through thought processes. My goal was to use my
natural personality to dictate the tone of the struggle. Just how a poker
player might hum a tune to put it in the head of an opponent (thereby
“getting in his head”), I would control the psychology of the game by
unmasking myself. If I sat up high in my chair in a natural display of
conﬁde nce, my opponent might wonder if I was covering something up. Was
this reverse psychology? Maybe reverse reverse psychology. Maybe reverse
reverse reverse psychology? In addition to the moves I made on the board, I
was posing another set of conundr ums for an opponent to ponder.
Of course I was not so transparent. Mixed in with my genuine impressions
would be misleading furrows of the brow, trickles of fear, or subtle ﬂutters of
excitement. Sometimes this type of deception would simply involve the
timing of a sip of water or a ﬂicker of my eyes. But not always. Against some
rivals, I would be completely straightforward emotionally with no attempt at
pretense. This open-book quality might continue from one tournament to the
next. Over time, my barely perceptible tells were steadily reliable, and my
opponent would trust what he was seeing. Gradually, my mood would become
part of his evaluative process—like a leg a martial artist is conditioned to
lean on before it is swept away. Whe n the right moment or critical game was
at hand, and I was faintly misleading about my current level of conﬁde nce, I
could provoke an overextension or an overly cautious decision. This was a
delicate dance.
At the same time, I was a careful observer of my rivals’ rhythms. As I
moved into my late teenage years, many of my tournaments were closed,
invitational events where ten to fourteen very strong players gathered for
two-week marathons. These were psychological wars. Imagine fourteen
world-class chess players living together in a small resort above a Bermuda
cliff. We ate meals together, took walks on the beach, formed complicated
friendships, compared notes about our approaches to the game—and everyafternoon at three o’clock, we went to battle. This type of environment was a
hotbed of psychological maneuvering.
It was during these years that I began to draw the parallels between
people’s life tendencies and their chessic dispositions. Great players are all, by
deﬁnition, very clever about what they show over the chessboard, but, in life’s
more munda ne moments, even the most cunning chess psychologists can
reveal certain essential nuances of character. If, over dinner, a Grandmaster
tastes something bitter and faintly wrinkles his nose, there might be an
inkling of a tell lurking. Impatience while standing on line at the buffet
might betray a problem sitting with tension. It’s amazing how much you can
learn about someone when they get caught in the rain! Some will run with
their hands over their heads, others will smile and take a deep breath while
enjoying the wind. Wha t does this say about one’s relationship to discomfort?
The reaction to surprise? The need for control?
By the time I moved into the competitive martial arts, I was very much in
tune with my tells, and was quite good at manipulating opponents’
impressions of my state of mind. I had also reached a fairly high level of
reading psychological wrinkles. It was during these years that I began to
cultivate methods of systematically controlling m y opponents’ intention.
In chess, a huge  amount of psychological observation and manipulation
might ultimately manifest as a subtle hitch in an opponent’s thought process.
In physical disciplines like the martial arts, getting into the opponent’s head
has an immediate and often violent effect that is much more visible to the
observing eye. Envision the following scene:
I’m competing against an experienced Push Hands opponent who has ﬁfty
pounds on me. He’s a good athlete, fast, strong, aggressive. The idea is to stay
on your feet and within the ring. In this matchup I’m not going to win with
force. It’s the mental side of the game that will be critical. The match begins
with our right wrists crossed. I apply light pressure on his wrist, and he
pushes back. The mood is set. As the play begins we circle one another. I
probe him with feints, and each time he comes back at me with a counter
attack. We go into the clinch, both of us having our right arms wrapped
unde rneath the opponent’s left armpit, both with our right legs forward. I
pulse twice with my right shoulder and each time he meets my pulse with
resistance. I break out of the clinch. I’m backing up. We play a little more, at
a distance. A few times I push into his midsection, and he conﬁde ntly holdshis ground. Then I create an opening, allowing him to close distance and pull
me back into the clinch. On the entry I pulse again with my right shoulder,
this time very subtly, and immediately trigger into a throw where I empty
out my right side and torque him into the hole. He hits the ground hard and
is confused. Wha t happened?
This is an overstated example of mental programming. Wha t I did here is
observe and provoke a pattern of action/reaction in my opponent. He was
much bigger than me, so probably entered the matchup wanting to impose
his power. I began by barely pressing against his wrist in the starting
position. Here he could have just neutralized my pressure, let it go, but
instead he held his ground, pushed back. I have engaged his ego. He is
already set up. Next I went into the clinch with the big guy and pushed twice
without any ambition to move him. I just wanted to more deeply inspire our
rhythm of dance. He’s big, I’m small. Whe n I push, he pushes back. If you
think about what this means, in that second in which he is responding to my
shoulder probe with counterforce, I am suppo rting some of his weight. I’m
becoming one of his legs. Whe n I backed out of the clinch that ﬁrst time, he
felt very good—he ’s gaining ground, I’m unha ppy—so he thinks. I continue
to inspire his push-back mentality for a few more moments and then I return
to the clinch. This time, my shoulder pulse is very subtle. He does not have
to make a decision to push back, it just happens reﬂexively, but now
immediately after my pulse, and actually just before his response begins, I
trigger into a throw that is entirely based on his approaching, programmed
reaction. I empty out my right side, which has the effect of removing the leg
he is just starting to lean on, and I add to his sliver of momentum with a
condensed, potent technique. He hits the ﬂoor in a blur. Whe never these
types of moments happen in the martial arts, it feels a little magical. He
experiences standing and then falling into a black hole because our ﬁnal
exchange was all very subtle and pe rhaps invisible to his conscious mind.
In actual martial play, these types of exchanges are much more reﬁned.
Imagine the condensing process of Making Smaller Circles applied to the
observation and programming side of this interaction. Wha t can really
happen is that our wrists meet and I apply the tiniest amount of pressure
conceivable. My opponent holds his ground without his conscious mind even
realizing that he has responded. He is already set up to be thrown with a one-
two combination because his reaction to the one is already predictable. I willmove before his two. Taking this one step further, if my ﬁrst movement is
condensed enough, it will hardly manifest physically at all. My two appears
to be a one. At the opponent’s slightest move, I move ﬁrst.
*  *  *
Consider one of the more interesting and psychologically subtle card tricks
performed by highly evolved illusionists. A magician is onstage and asks an
audience member to join him. Whe n the volunteer (a genuinely unplanted
middle-aged man who seems to be enjoying the show) approaches, the
performer holds his attention for a few moments while he handles the cards.
Then the illusionist lays the ﬁfty-two cards (a real deck) on a table and asks
the man to think about a card. Visualize it. The magician then shufﬂes the
cards, lays the deck on the table, and asks the volunteer to ﬂip the top card. It
is the envisioned card. Wha t happened here? Did the magician really read the
man’s mind and then miraculously separate that card from the other ﬁfty-
one? Of course not.
This particular illusion is very much in line with the controlling of
intention that a martial artist might employ. The key is the subtle
manipulation of the volunteer’s conscious and unconscious minds. It all
happens before the “magic” begins. As the two men stand before one another,
in conversation, the illusionist engages the volunteer. This interaction is
dictated by the magician. The volunteer is answering questions, following,
trying to look good onstage. In the midst of all this, and in a blur that no one
in the audience notices, the illusionist ﬂashes a card. This is the sleight of
hand. The critical point is that the volunteer must unconsciously notice the
card without the observation registering in his conscious mind. He is
engaged in the banter of the illusionist, and then sudde nly has a seed planted
in his mind. Whe n asked to envision a card, that choice has already been
made for him. Manipulating the card througho ut the shufﬂe so it remains at
the top of the deck is child’s play for a halfway-decent sleight of hand artist.
The subtlety of this deception is that if the performer fails to fully engage the
man’s conscious mind, then the clever volunteer will realize he’s being
programmed and de cide to choose another card—the trick won’t work.
*  *  *If a pattern of interaction is recognizable to the adversary, then mental
conditioning will not be terribly effective. In the Push Hands scene I
described above, had my opponent recognized that his ego was being
manipulated, he could have thwarted my plan. My feigned unha ppiness and
backing up made him feel powerful, conﬁde nt, so he was not on the lookout
for being set up. This allowed a series of subtle conditioning exchanges,
which ﬁnally erupted into a throw. If I had really shoved the guy, he surely
would have recognized what I was doing. I had to operate beneath his radar.
This is where Making Smaller Circles and Slowing Down Time come into
play. When working with highly skilled and mentally tough opponents, the
psychological game gets increasingly subtle. The battle becomes about
reading breath patterns and blinks of the eye, playing in frames the opponent
is unaware of, invisible technical manipulation that slowly creates response
patterns. If I understand a series of movements more deeply, in more frames,
with more detail, then I can manipulate my opponent’s intention without
him realizing w hat happened.
Here is an example of how this might be done. Stand up with your feet
shoulder-width apart. Put your weight in your left leg. Now, imagine
somebody is standing on your left side and pushes into your body and up
through your left arm with a lot of force. How are you going to keep your
balance? Well, you have to lift up your right leg, go with the momentum,
and then replant your right foot a couple feet away and land—as if you
jumped sideways—no  problem. Now put all your weight in your right leg,
again, feet shoulder-width apart. If someone were to push you from your left
shoulder, you would have a much bigger problem because your right leg is
stuck to the ground. A funda mental principle of maintaining balance while
moving fast (for example while neutralizing a martial artist’s throw or
explosive push) is that your feet should never cross. Now when you go
airborne, your left foot has to make the long journey past your right if you are
going to have any chance of staying up. You’ll be all crossed up and probably
crash into the ground. T his is a simple idea with huge  implications.
Much of the Push Hands game takes place with the two players connected
up top. Hands and arms are subtly probing for tension. If I push into an
opponent, he will either resist my force or empty out the attacked part of his
body, dodge the blow, and let the aggression pass by. In either case, there will
be a subtle shift in weight. This is a critical moment. In that blur duringwhich someone switches weight from one foot to another, the receiving leg is
momentarily stuck. It cannot move. At a high level, athletes have developed
very powerful throws. If someone is slightly off balance or unable to move
freely with incoming force, he will not be able to catch up before he is
hurtling toward the ground. If I trigger a throw toward someone’s right foot
at the precise moment that his right foot is settling onto the ground, then
my opponent will not be able to correct himself. His footwork will get all
twisted up. This idea is far from unique to the martial arts. If a tennis player
has someone leaning left and hits the ball just out of reach to the right, the
opponent will appear ﬂat footed and paralyzed. If an NFL running back, NBA
ball handler, or World Cup soccer player can get the defender to put weight
in the wrong place at the wrong time, then he can blow on by and leave the
guy tripping over himself. In virtually every competitive physical discipline,
if you are a master of reading and m anipulating footwork, then you are a force
to be reckoned with.
So let’s build a game around the simple principle of weight redistribution.
There are two intertwined components to this process. The ﬁrst is condensed
technique. The second is enhanced perception. Our goal is to take advantage
of the moment our opponent is switching his weight from one foot to
another. There are many weaknesses or tells that may be used to approach this
goal—breath patterns, physical tension, inferior technical unde rstanding,
complacency, emotion, distraction, and an array of other unconscious,
predictable habits can all be homed in on or combined for the desired effect.
For simplicity’s sake, let’s focus on the eyes. Speciﬁcally the blink.
First of all, most people blink without knowing it, so they probably won’t
consider it a weakness that may be exploited in competition. Even for top
competitors, there is not much of a sense of danger associated with the blink
—it happens so quickly, everything feels safe. But it isn’t. There is a small
change in awareness that accompanies the ﬂash of eyes, and a highly skilled
player can train himself to exploit it. This is where the methodology of
Slowing Down Time comes into play. If, through incremental training as
described earlier in the book, your unconscious unde rstanding of your
discipline of choice has become sufﬁciently advanced, and you have learned
how to trust your physical and intuitive intelligence to handle the technical
components of your moment, then your conscious mind can zoom in on very
small amounts of data—in this case, the eyes. Because our minds are socomplex, if you give us a small amount of material to work with, and w e do it
with great intensity, then we can break it down into microscopic detail. If our
conscious mind is purely focused on the eyes, they will seem to take a while
to blink. We see them beginning to close, closed, starting to open, and then
open again. That’s all we need.
So let’s say I am doing Push Hands with a very skilled opponent. I’m in
the zone, feeling his weight, his patterns of movement, his eyes. He has
certain tells. Before a blink, maybe his cheek twitches. Maybe a touch of
moisture forms around his pupil. Or maybe his eyes close a tiny bit, then
reopen, then blink. All this is subtle, but I am tapped in. Both of our right
legs are forward and we are moving around the ring. In Push Hands you need
to hold your ground to stay in the ring. Sometimes you have to root off the
rear leg but you don’t want to spend too much time with your weight shifted
back since that gives you nowhere to go: there’s not much give in your
structure. Skilled players have internalized this reality, but their training can
be used against them. We are ﬂowing. Then, on his blink, or just before it
begins, I pulse into a one-two combination, left, right, into his body. My
movements are very small; I don’t put much force into them. Very little
seems to be happening. But my right puts him into his back leg, just barely
taking the weight off his front leg. Whe n I release the pressure from my
right hand, in the middle of his blink, when his presence is slightly altered,
his body instinctively settles back toward his forward leg. In that instant, I
trigger into a throw which combines the fact that he is moving forward,
providing momentum, and for a microsecond anchoring his forward leg to
the ﬂoor. If I am good, all this can happen before he has ﬁnished blinking. He
goes ﬂying onto the ground a nd comes up c onfused.
Time and again I have used this type of strategy in competition, and
afterward opponents have come over to me and implied that I did something
mystical. They were standing and then on the ground, and they didn’t feel or
see anything occur in-between. Of course there is nothing mystical
happening, just the interplay of some interesting psychological, technical,
and learning principles. I read his intention to blink and then controlled his
intention by determining when he would unconsciously place his weight into
his forward leg. If I did this well, my movements—the one-two combination
—should barely have been visible. They served the lone purpose of
manipulating weight distribution. I should point out that the speciﬁcexample of using a blink is just one of many options, and it can be
neutralized.
Whe n preparing for the 2004 World Championships, my main training
partner was my dear friend Daniel Caulﬁeld. Dan is a phenomenal martial
artist who placed second in the world in his weight division. He’s a ﬁerce
competitor, deeply perceptive, with a philosopher’s soul that gives his martial
style a unique resonance. During our training for the Worlds, Dan and I
squared off on the mat every night with the intensity of tournament
opponents. It was strange going to war with each other after so many years of
friendship. We knew each other’s games intimately—there were no technical
secrets—so our battles were largely of the mind. In the ﬁnal three months of
preparation, we made the risky agreement to each be responsible for his own
safety, which liberated us to play as we would in the championships. There
was no holding back. If one of us was slightly off, he got annihilated and had
to stew in his juices until the next session. If one of us detected a tell or
weakness in the other, he went after it relentlessly until a defensive
adjustment was made. We weren’t just competing in the ring, we were
honing our abilities to read and m ask the subtlest signs on the ﬂy.
Dan is a brilliant guy with tremendously explosive power and razor-sharp
technique. He knew even my tiniest habits. Every exhalation was dangerous.
If my presence diminished for a fraction of a second, I was on the ﬂoor. The
air felt electric during these sessions. We taped our training and every week I
broke down the video. Depending on the day, one or both of us seemed to be
operating in a different dimension. Time felt slowed down or sped up. A
couple of times when Dan was really on, I blinked and by the time my eyes
were open, I was in midair, ﬂying out of the ring. This was my secret! No one
had ever turned it on me before. An adjustment was called for, and I got into
the habit of taking a tiny step back or pulsing into Dan on my blinks,
creating a little space so he couldn’t ﬁre in on me. A few times when I was
really ﬂowing, I used Dan’s awareness of my eye patterns against him,
blinking to pull him into an overextension. He quickly caught on to my ruse
and our psychology continued to evolve. If both players are aware of a tell,
then it will be neutralized, made ineffective, and others will have to be
unearthed and exploited. The game goes on.
This type of psychological warfare is at the center of nearly all high-level
competitive disciplines—and I mean competitive in the loosest senseimaginable. For example, the car salesman and potential buyer are opponents.
Whe n two highly trained minds square off, in any ﬁeld, the players are in a
ﬁght to enter each other’s heads. These exchanges feel like epic tennis rallies
in which the tilt of battle sways back and forth as one player picks up on a
faint tell that may or may not exist long enough to be exploited, and the
other has to feel the danger, and swat the rival out of his mind before it is too
late.
While reﬁned mental competitors can have extended dialogues of this
nature, in my observation most people are relatively unaware of their
psychological subtleties. This makes for easy pickings for the astute rival. So
beware when squaring off with a well-versed negotiator, salesman, or lawyer!
Understand that the battle stretches well beyond the traditional arena. Whe n
one player is more aware of these issues than the other, conditioning is quite
simple. Quarterbacks ﬂick their eyes and send safeties ﬂying all over the
football ﬁeld. Real estate moguls furrow their brows, act impatient, check
their watches to lull buyers into nervous offers. A chess player observes a
rhythm, then sits, lets his clock tick even though a decision has already been
reached, then ﬁnally makes his move just as the opponent predictably gets up
to go to the bathroom. Wha t now? Take a minute, go to the bathroom, come
back. Control the pace of the game. Awareness of these dynamics can make
you hard to manipulate, and can allow you to turn the tables on even the
savviest of conditioners.
To master these psychological battles, it is essential to unde rstand their
technical founda tion. Contrary to the ego-enforcing descriptions of some
“kung fu masters,” there is nothing mystical about controlling intention or
entering the mind of the opponent. These are skills to be cultivated like any
other, and the last few chapters have been my attempt to lay out the road map
to their internalization.PART III
BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER
CHAPTER 15
THE POWER OF PRESENCE
In October 2005, I spent two weeks in the Amazon jungle. My father had to
go to Brazil to research gold mining operations for his book The Dream
Merchant, and there was no way I was going to let my pop disappear into the
jungle without me. My buddy  Dan took the trip with us because he’d always
dreamed of the Amazon. We spent much of the trip 250 kilometers south of
Manaus, in an area called Tupana, where the outer reaches of the
TransAmazonian Highway, the only connection to civilization, dwindle from
a pitted two-lane road into a dirt path, with the forest canopy closing in from
all sides until the trees are overhead and engulf what remains of the clearing.
Every ten or twenty miles, tiny villages exist virtually untouched by the
modern world. In this remote part of Brazil, there is a deep respect for the
thin line between life and death. There are no layers of protection such as the
ones most of us are used to. No grocery stores, no hospitals, no ambulances or
policemen to buffer a bad moment. There is the sense among Amazonians
that the jungle sits poised to devour the unwary. No one walks into the forest
alone. Most people carry weapons. The danger is too great.
While we lived in the rainforest, a man named Manuel acted as our guide.
Manuel is a native Amazonian, born in Tupana, about ﬁfty years old,
powerfully built with shining brown eyes and the jungle in his blood. He led
us through the dense foliage, quietly pointing out medicinal trees, animal
tracks, insects, monkey vines, the signs of the forest. From time to time he
would stop, raise a hand. Minutes passed. We stood silent and listened, the
air alive with the sound of animals feeding or moving nearby. Manuel carried
a shotgun. His friend Marcelo trailed us with another. Cats were always on
the mind.Througho ut the trip, Dan and I asked a lot of questions about the jaguar.
Walking through the forest at night, we wanted to be prepared for an
encounter. We were given spears, which made us feel better. But over and
over Manuel shook his head and explained that if a jaguar really wants you,
there will not be much ﬁght. It is rare for someone to speak of seeing a jaguar
in the forest. If you see one, it’s probably too late. People traveling in groups
will, for the most part, be left alone. From time to time, the last person in a
procession will be picked off from behind, but cats generally avoid teams.
They are stealth hunters. A lone traveler will be moving through the forest,
and the cat will be crouched on a limb of an overhanging tree, blending into
the forest canopy, listening, waiting. Then the ambush emerges from
nowhere, and the cat is on your neck. In Manuel’s descriptions of the jaguar,
there seemed to be an almost religious respect for its power, cunning, and
intensity. But what if I have a machete? How could I not have a chance?
One evening, lying in hammocks above the forest ﬂoor, engulfed by deep
blackness and the wild symphony of night sounds, Manuel told us what
happened to a friend of his a few years before. This man was named José. He
was born in the Amazon. He knew the jungle’s sounds, its smells, its signs.
He knew how to heal every conceivable ailment with saps and boiled barks of
trees, roots, leaves. He climbed vines like a monkey, hunted every evening
with a blowgun and darts laced with the venom of poisonous frogs. José could
operate from sound and smell alone, freezing in the dark forest, listening,
then shooting his dart into the dusky woods and hitting his mark for his
family’s dinner. He was one of the rare ones who ventured into the forest
alone. On these evenings, he wore a mask on his head, eyes pointing backward
so the cats would not ambush him from behind. His only weapon was his
small blowgun a nd a machete he apparently wielded like a samurai.
One night José was moving through the forest, darkness closing in, on the
way home with a small capybara strapped to his back. Sudde nly his skin
prickled. He stopped, listened, heard the deep rumble of a cat. He smelled
the animal, knew it was near. He felt for his blowgun, but it had been a long
night hunting and there were no darts left. José was standing next to a giant
Sumaumeira tree, which are often used by Amazonians for communicating
over long distances in the jungle. Immediately, José took his machete and
swung it back and forth in a blur, clanging against the tree’s magniﬁcent
exposed root and sending a pounding call for help through the darkness.These vibrations can be heard over a mile away. Hopefully his son would be
listening.
Then José stood in silence, waiting. H e smelled the cat. It was close. A few
moments later a large black jaguar, onza negra, over two hundr ed pounds,
glided down from a tree twenty feet ahead of him and started moving in. José
remembered the glowing yellow eyes, as though a demon were coming for
him. He knew if he ran the cat would be on him instantly. He tossed his
night’s catch forward onto the forest ﬂoor, then held his machete and stood
his ground, moving his weapon rhythmically, preparing for the ﬁght of his
life. The cat walked straight toward him, and then changed course about
eight feet away. It started pacing. Back and forth, keeping distance, but never
taking its eyes off José. It watched the machete, followed its movements.
At ﬁrst, the jaguar’s pacing felt good. José thought that maybe it was
indecisive, considering the dead rodent. The minutes passed. José’s arm got
tired from swaying. He watched the rippling muscles of the cat’s legs,
imagined them hurling the beast on top of him. There would be only one
chance. Whe n the cat came, he would need to dodge and strike in a blur. He
would have to get to the neck or take off a limb and somehow roll away from
the razor claws. It would all happen in an instant. But the waiting was eating
him up inside. His whole being was on edge, poised for battle, exploding,
while the cat paced, languid, easy, yellow eyes glowing, edging closer, now
seven feet away, now six feet. After ten minutes the tension was unbe arable.
José was drenched in sweat, his right arm shook from the weight of the
machete. He switched hands, felt the weapon in his left, hoped the cat didn’t
notice the new awkwardness for a minute or so while he recovered. He felt
dreamy, as if the cat were hypnotizing him. Fear overwhelmed him. This man
of the jungle was falling apart.
After ﬁfteen minutes, the cat started moving faster. It edged in, coiled,
watched the machete move, then turned back to pacing. It looked for
openings, felt the timing of the weapon. José was all strung out. His nerves
were frayed. The yellow eyes were taking him over. His body shook. José
started sobbing. He backed away from the cat, and this was a mistake. The
jaguar moved in. Straight in. It showed its teeth, crouched to leap. José had
no ﬁght left. He gave himself up and there was a crack through the night.
Then shouting. The cat turned. Another crack rang out and then two young
men ran through the bush screaming. José’s son took aim with his gun, butthe cat vanished into the darkness, leaving a father weeping on the jungle
ﬂoor. Three years later, José still hadn’t recovered from this encounter. The
villagers say he went mad. His spirit was broken.
Whe n I heard this story, suspended in the Amazonian night, I was struck
by how much I related to both the predator and the prey. I used to create
chaos on the chessboard until my opponents crumbled from the pressure. I
loved the unkno wn, the questions, and they wanted answers. Whe n there were
no answers, I was home and they were terriﬁed. The game was mine. Then my
psychology got complicated and the tables were turned. In my early
encounters with world-class Grandmasters, I was usually beaten like José.
The chess position might be objectively even, but as the tension on the board
mounted it felt as though a vise was slowly cinching down on my head,
tighter, tighter, until I reached a bursting point and made some small
concession like José backing up, a tiny imprecision that changed the
character of the game, anything to release the pressure on my brain. Then
they were all over me.
Grandmasters know how to make the subtlest cracks decisive. The only
thing to do was become immune to the pain, embrace it, until I could work
through hours of mind-numbing complexities as if I were taking a lovely
walk in the park. The vise, after all, was only in my head. I spent years
working on this issue, learning how to maintain the tension—becoming at
peace with mounting pressure. Then, as a martial artist, I turned this
training to my advantage, making my opponents explode from mental
combustion because of my higher threshold for discomfort.
In every discipline, the ability to be clearheaded, present, cool unde r ﬁre is
much of what separates the best from the mediocre. In competition, the
dynamic is often painfully transparent. If one player is serenely present while
the other is being ripped apart by internal issues, the outcome is already
clear. The prey is no longer objective, makes compounding mistakes, and the
predator moves in for the kill. While more subtle, this issue is perhaps even
more critical in solitary pursuits such as writing, painting, scholarly
thinking, or learning. In the absence of continual external reinforcement, we
must be our own monitor, and quality of presence is often the best gauge. We
cannot expect to touch excellence if “going through the motions” is the norm
of our lives. On the other hand, if deep, ﬂuid presence becomes second nature,
then life, art, and learning take on a richness that will continually surpriseand delight. Those who excel are those who maximize each moment’s creative
potential—for these masters of living, presence to the day-to-day learning
process is akin to that purity of focus others dream of achieving in rare
climactic moments when everything is on the line.
The secret is that everything is always on the line. The more present we
are at practice, the more present we will be in competition, in the boardroom,
at the exam, the operating table, the big stage. If we have any hope of
attaining excellence, let alone of showing what we’ve got unde r pressure, we
have to be prepared by a lifestyle of reinforcement. Presence must be like
breathing.CHAPTER 16
SEARCHING FOR THE ZONE
How can I learn to enter the zone at will, make it a way of life? How can I
maintain my focus unde r pressure, stay serene and principled unde r ﬁre,
overcome distraction? Wha t do I do when my emotions get out of control?
In Part I, I told the story of my chess career predominantly within the
framework of the learning process. Now I’d like to brieﬂy reexamine the arc
of those years from the perspective of the performance psychologist. Recall
that as a young boy, sometimes I became so deeply immersed in a chess
position that the world seemed to fall away. Nothing existed but me and my
jungle. During these moments my mother says I seemed to become an old
man, as if I knew this game from another life, playing for hours with a focus
so intense that she thought her hand would burn if she placed it between my
eyes and the board. Other days I would be distracted, chew bubbl e gum, look
around a nd smile at spectators in Washington Square Park. It was hit or miss,
and my poor parents and coach had to sit and deal with whichever Josh
showed up t hat day.
In time, when I started playing tournaments, I had to be more consistent
and so I started spending more effort on concentration. I sat at the board
when I wanted to walk around. Whe n my mood was ﬂippant, I sucked it up
and worked harder. I was an intense competitor, and have never been one to
give up on a goal. As a funny  aside, my ever-precocious sister started amusing
herself with this never-quit aspect of my personality when she was three years
old by giving me coconuts to open on Bahamian beaches. I’d spend hours
smashing away in the sun, refusing to give up until she was drinking and
munching away. In my scholastic chess life I was almost always able to putmore energy into the struggle than my opponents. If it was a battle of wills, I
won.
Whe n I started competing in adult tournaments, my amped-up energy
and focus sometimes worked against me. If you recall the chapter The Soft
Zone, I began having pr oblems with music or other distractions that got stuck
in my mind. Initially I tried to push the world away from me, keep
everything silent, but this just ampliﬁed the noise. A random song,
whispering spectators, distant sirens, ticking chess clocks, would take over
my brain until chess became almost impossible to play. Then I had the
breakthrough to think to the beat of the song, embrace distraction, and ﬁnd
an inner focus that could exist no matter what the external environment. For
years I trained myself to deal with bad conditions, use them to my advantage.
It turns out that the next movement of my life would put this training to
the test on a much larger scale. Whe n I was ﬁfteen years old, Searching for
Bobby Fischer was released and my life went Hollywood. Sudde nly I was in the
media spotlight and the struggles of the chess world were compounde d by
extra pressures on my shoulders. Whe n I played tournaments, fans were all
over me, cameras followed me around, o ther players seethed with jealousy. If I
had been more mature, I might have been able to translate my youthful
experiences with music to this larger form of distraction. But I was off-
balance and once again resorted to using my will to block everything out.
Instead of rolling with the new vibe of my life, I handled the pressures by
putting huge  amounts of energy into each chess game.
I recall two moments in particular when I became a man possessed. One
game was a critical matchup in the U.S. Junior Championship against the
gifted Romanian émigré, Grandmaster Gabriel Schwartzman. The other was
in the U.S. Championship in 1994, when I squared off against my trainer at
the time, Grandmaster Gregory Kaidanov. In both games, the stakes were
high, both professionally and emotionally. I was all business, and my
intensity was a little wild. Both four-hour struggles passed in a blink.
Nothing else existed for me. At one point during our matchup, while I was
staring lasers at the board, working my way through the position,
Schwartzman walked over to my father, who was in the audience, and told
him that he had never seen me like this—he  said my concentration was so
ﬁerce it was scary sitting across from me. Against Kaidanov, I felt like a tiger
in a cage, seething with raw energy. I won both those games, and played someof my most inspired chess, but what is interesting is that afterward I was
profoundly depleted and in both cases my tournament immediately fell apart.
I blew myself out and ha d nothing left for the rest of the competitions.
In short, I was a mess. I had learned as a boy how to deal with distraction
in a given moment, but the larger distractions of my life were overwhelming
me. In an isolated situation, I could overcome the issues—I’ve always been
able to bring it for the big game—but  the kind of reckless intensity this
required sapped me. At a high level the chess world has many big games and
in long, grueling tournaments they tend to follow one another, over and over,
for days and weeks at a time. I knew how to block out my issues in a sprint,
but in marathons I ran out of gas. Consistency became a critical problem. On
days that I was inspired, I was unstoppable. But other days I would play bad
chess. The time had come for me to learn the science of long-term, healthy,
self-sustaining pe ak performance.
In the fall of 1996 my father read about the sports psychologist Jim Loehr,
who ran a performance training center called LGE in Orlando, Florida. LGE
(recently renamed the Human Performance Institute) was founde d by Loehr,
the esteemed sports nutritionist Jack Groppel, and the no-nonsense physical
trainer Pat Etcheberry as an environment in which the physical and mental
sides of the pursuit of excellence converged. By the time I ﬁrst went down to
LGE in December of ’96, it was already becoming a mecca for athletes who
wanted to hone their performance skills, professionalize their nutritional
patterns, work out sophisticated everyday training routines to optimize
growth, and balance public and personal lives. World-class tennis players,
golfers, NFL and NBA stars, Olympic athletes, top CEOs, FBI SWAT teams,
basically any kind of elite performer could be found on a given day working
out in the high-tech gym, meeting with sports psychologists, or chatting
with one another about the similarities of their experiences.
I’ll never forget my ﬁrst afternoon in the LGE weight room. I was working
with a trainer, having tests done on me to determine my exact level of ﬁtness.
I was using muscles I never knew existed, pushing my physical limits far
beyond what I would have known was safe or possible—and I loved it. This
was my ﬁrst exposure to physical training at as high a level of professionalism
and sophistication as I had been conditioning my mind for so many years.
There I was, sprinting on a high-tech stationary bike, sweating up a storm,
hooked up to all sorts of monitors, when a guy slapped me on my back. Iturned around to see Jim Harbaugh with a big smile on his face. At the time,
Jim was the star quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts. Being a huge  Jets
fan, I had not always rooted for Jim, but I had watched him play for years and
admired his ﬁery competitive spirit. He had an arm like a cannon, was
famous for last-minute comebacks, and was simply a fabulous athlete. I was
surprised when Jim told me that he was also an avid chess player and had
followed my career for a long time. We fell into a conversation about the
psychological parallels of top-notch chess competition and quarterbacking in
the NFL. I was amazed by how many of the same issues we wrestled with. I
think that this conversation in the LGE gym was my ﬁrst real inkling of how
universal the arts of learning and pe rformance really are.
*  *  *
The two intertwined issues I wanted to take on at LGE were consistency as a
competitor and my complicated relationship to the baggage that had come
with Searching for Bobby Fischer. Whe n I ﬁrst went down to Orlando shortly
after my twentieth birthday, I was still a pretty intuitive performer,
operating from a natural mix of intensity, digested experience, and drive. As I
described above, when things got rocky, my habit was to hit the gas and blow
my opponent and myself out of the water with wildly energetic focus. This
was clearly less than an ideal approach for the long term.
The main trainer that I worked with at LGE was a deeply insightful sports
psychologist named Dave Striegel. Over the years, Dave and I developed a
close relationship and frequently spoke on the phone between my trips to
Orlando. Although many valuable insights emerged from our dialogues,
perhaps the most explosive revelation emerged from an innocent question
during our ﬁrst meeting. I remember it clearly: after a few hours of
conversation in which I described my life, my career, my current issues, Dave
sat back, scratched his head, and asked me whether or not I believed the
quality of a chessic thought process was higher if it was preceded by a period
of relaxation. This simple question led to a revolution in my approach to peak
performance.
That evening, after a long day of eye-opening sessions with Dave, Jim
Loehr, and Jack Groppel, I sat down with my laptop and chess notebooks and
spent a few hours looking over my previous year of competitions. Duringchess tournaments, players notate their games as they go along. The
chessboard is seen as a grid, with vertical ranks running a–h from left to
right, and the horizontal ﬁles running 1–8, up from white’s perspective. After
each move, a chess player will write down, for example, Bg4 or Qh5, meaning
Bishop moves to g4 or Queen moves to h5. Usually notation is kept on a
sheet with a carbon copy beneath, which allows public and private records of
all chess games to be saved. For a number of years, when notating my games,
I had also written down how long I thought on each move. This had the
purpose of helping me manage my time usage, but after my ﬁrst session with
Dave, it also led to the discovery of a very interesting pattern. Looking back
over my games, I saw that when I had been playing well, I had two- to ten-
minute, crisp thinks. Whe n I was off my game, I would sometimes fall into a
deep calculation that lasted over twenty minutes and this “long think” often
led to an inaccuracy. Wha t is more, if I had a number of long thinks in a row,
the quality of my decisions tended to deteriorate.
The next morning, Striegel and Loehr told me about their concept of Stress
and Recovery. The physiologists at LGE had discovered that in virtually every
discipline, one of the most telling features of a dominant performer is the
routine use of recovery periods. Players who are able to relax in brief
moments of inactivity are almost always the ones who end up coming
through when the game is on the line. This is why the eminent tennis players
of their day, such as Ivan Lendl and Pete Sampras, had those strangely
predictable routines of serenely picking their rackets between points, whether
they won or lost the last exchange, while their rivals fumed at a bad call or
pumped a ﬁst in excitement. Consider Tiger Woods, strolling to his next
shot, with a relaxed focus in his eyes. Remember Michael Jordan sitting on
the bench, a towel on his shoulders, letting it all go for a two-minute break
before coming back in the game? Jordan was completely serene on the bench
even though the Bulls desperately needed him on the court. He had the
fastest recovery time of any athlete I’ve ever seen. Jim Harbaugh told me
about the ﬁrst time he noticed this pattern in himself. He’s a passionate guy,
and liked to root on his defense when they were on the ﬁeld. But after his ﬁrst
sessions at LGE he noticed a clear improvement in his play if he sat on the
bench, relaxed, and didn’t even watch the other team’s offensive series. The
more he could let things go, the sharper he was in the next drive.The notion that I didn’t have to hold myself in a state of feverish
concentration every second of a chess game was a huge  liberation. The most
immediate change I made was my way of handling chess games when it was
not my turn to move. Instead of feeling obligated to stay completely focused
on the chess position while my opponent thought, I began to let my mind
release some of the tension. I might think about the position in a more
abstract way, or I might even walk away from the board and have a drink of
water or wash my face. Whe n my opponent made his move, I would return to
the board with renewed energy. Immediately I started noticing improvement
in my play.
In the coming months, as I became more attuned to the qualitative
ﬂuctuations of my thought processes, I found that if a think of mine went
over fourteen minutes, it would often become repetitive and imprecise. After
noticing this pattern, I learned to monitor the efﬁciency of my thinking. If it
started to falter, I would release everything for a moment, recover, and then
come back with a fresh slate. Now when faced with difﬁcult chess positions, I
could think for thirty or forty minutes at a very high level, because my
concentration was fueled by little breathers.
At LGE, they made a science of the gathering and release of intensity, and
found that, regardless of the discipline, the better we are at recovering, the
greater potential we have to endure and pe rform unde r stress. That realization
is a good starting point. But how do we learn to let go? It is much easier to
tell someone to relax than to actually do it on the free-throw line in overtime
of the NBA playoffs or in the moments before making a career-deﬁning
presentation. This is where the mind-body connection comes in.
The physical conditioners at LGE taught me to do cardiovascular interval
training on a stationary bike that had a heart monitor. I would ride a bike
keeping my RPMs over 100, at a resistance level that made my heart rate go
to 170 be ats per minute after ten minutes of exertion. Then I would lower the
resistance level of the bike and go easy for a minute—my heart rate would
return to 144 or so. Then I would sprint again, at a very high level of
resistance, and my heart rate would reach 170 again after a minute. Next I
would go easy for another minute before sprinting again, and so on. My body
and mind were undul ating between hard work and release. The recovery time
of my heart got progressively shorter as I continued to train this way. As I got
into better condition, it took more work to raise my heart rate, and less timeto lower my heart rate during rest: soon my rest intervals were only forty-ﬁve
seconds and m y sprint times longer.
Wha t is fascinating about this method of physical conditioning is that
after just a few weeks I noticed a tangible difference in my ability to relax
and recover between arduous thought processes in a chess game. At LGE they
had discovered that there is a clear physiological connection when it comes to
recovery—cardiovascular interval training can have a profound effect on your
ability to quickly release tension and recover from mental exhaustion. Wha t
is more, physical ﬂushing and mental clarity are very much intertwined.
There was more than one occasion that I got up from the board four or ﬁve
hours into a huge ly tense chess game, walked outside the playing hall, and
sprinted ﬁfty yards or up six ﬂights of stairs. Then I’d walk back, wash my
face, and be  completely renewed.
To this day, virtually every element of my physical training revolves
around one form or another of stress and recovery. For example, during
weight workouts, the LGE guys taught me to precisely monitor how much
time I leave between sets, so that my muscles have ample time to recover, but
are still pushed to improve their recovery time. Whe n I began this form of
interval training, if I was doing 3 sets of 15 repetitions of a bench press, I
would leave exactly 45 seconds between sets. If I was doing 3 sets of 12
repetitions with heavier weights, I would need 50 seconds between sets, if my
sets were 10 reps I would take 55 seconds, and if I was lifting heavy weights,
at 3 sets of 8 reps, I would take one minute between reps. This is a good
baseline for an average athlete to work with. In time, with consistent work,
rest periods can be incrementally shortened even as muscles grow and are
stressed to their larger healthy limits.
Over the years I have gotten better and better at returning from mental
and physical exhaustion. While in my chess career the necessity of such
intense body work may seem strange, in my martial arts life it is clear as day
—the ﬁghter who can recover in the thirty seconds between rounds and in the
irregular intervals between matches will have a huge  advantage over the guy
who is still hufﬁng and pufﬁng, mentally or physically, from the last battle.
On a more dynamic level, in Tai Chi Chuan, real martial power springs from
the explosion from emptiness to fullness, or from the soft into the hard. So
there are countless moments when I will release all tension for a split second
in the midst of a martial ﬂurry. Ultimately, with incremental training verymuch like what I described in the chapter Making Smaller Circles, recovery
time can become nearly instantaneous. And once the act of recovery is in our
blood, we’ll be able to access it unde r the most strained of circumstances,
becoming masters of creating tiny havens for renewal, even where observers
could not conceive of such a break.
*  *  *
In your performance training, the ﬁrst step to mastering the zone is to
practice the ebb and ﬂow of stress and recovery. This should involve interval
training as I have described above, at whatever level of difﬁculty is
appropriate for the age and physical conditioning of the individual. This
training could, of course, take many forms: I have already mentioned biking
and resistance work, but let’s say you enjoy swimming laps in a pool. Instead
of just swimming until you are exhausted and then quitting, push yourself to
your healthy limit, then recover for a minute or two, and then push yourself
again. Create a rhythm of intervals like the one I described with my biking.
With practice, increase the intensity and duration of your sprint time, and
gradually condense rest periods—you are on your way! This same pattern can
be used with jogging, weight lifting, martial arts training, or playing any
sport that involves cardiovascular work.
If you are interested in really improving as a performer, I would sugge st
incorporating the rhythm of stress and recovery into all aspects of your life.
Truth be told, this is what my entire approach to learning is based on—
breaking down the artiﬁcial barriers between our diverse life experiences so
all moments become enriched by a sense of interconnectedness. So, if you are
reading a book and lose focus, put the book down, take some deep breaths,
and pick it up again with a fresh eye. If you are at work and ﬁnd yourself
running out of mental stamina, take a break, wash your face, and come back
renewed. It would be an excellent idea to spend a few minutes a day doing
some simple meditation practice in which your mind gathers and releases
with the ebb and ﬂow of your breath. This will help connect your physical
interval training to the mental arenas. If you enjoy the experience, gradually
build up your mental stamina and spend more time at it. Whe n practiced
properly, Tai Chi Chuan, Yoga, or many forms of sitting meditation can be
excellent vehicles for this work.As we get better and better at releasing tension and coming back with a
full tank of gas in our everyday activities, both physical and mental, we will
gain conﬁde nce in our abilities to move back and forth between
concentration, adrenaline ﬂow, physical exertion (any kind of stress), and
relaxation. I can’t tell you how liberating it is to know that relaxation is just
a blink away from full awareness. Besides adding to your psychological and
physical resilience, this opens up some wonderful and surprising new
possibilities. For one thing, now that your conscious mind is free to take
little breaks, you’ll be delighted by the surges of creativity that will emerge
out of your unconscious. You’ll become more attuned to your intuition and
will slowly become more and more true to yourself stylistically. The
unconscious mind is a powerful tool, and learning ho w to relax unde r pressure
is a key ﬁrst step to tapping into its potential.
Interval work is a critical building block to becoming a consistent long-
term performer. If you spend a few months practicing stress and recovery in
your everyday life, you’ll lay the physiological founda tion for becoming a
resilient, dependable pressure player. The next step is to create your trigger
for the zone.CHAPTER 17
BUILDING YOUR TRIGGER
One of the biggest roadblocks to releasing the tension during breaks of
intense competition or in any other kind of challenging environment is the
fear of whether we will be able to get it back. If getting focused is hit or
miss, how can we give up our focus once we’ve ﬁnally got it? Conditioning to
this insecurity begins young. As children, we might be told to “concentrate”
by parents and teachers, and then be reprimanded if we look off into the stars.
So the child learns to associate not focusing with being “bad.” The result is
that we concentrate with everything we’ve got until we can’t withstand the
pressure and have a meltdown. While later on in my career, I sometimes blew
myself out with intensity during a game, in my early scholastic chess
tournaments my dad and I were very good at preserving my energy. Most of
my young rivals had coaches who treated tournaments like military camp.
Teachers and parents would make kids analyze their games extensively
between rounds, trying to wring a chess lesson out of every moment, while I
would be outside having a catch with my dad or taking a nap. Maybe it is no
accident that I tended to surge at the end of tournaments. My pop is a clever
guy.
This tendency of competitors to exhaust themselves between rounds of
tournaments is surprisingly widespread and very self-destructive. Whe never I
visit scholastic chess events today, I see coaches trying to make themselves
feel useful or showing off for parents by teaching students long technical
lessons immediately following a two-hour game and an hour before the next
round. Let the kid rest! Fueling up is much more important than last-minute
cramming—a nd at a higher level, the ability to recover will be pivotal. In
long chess tournaments that may last for over two weeks, one of the mostdecisive factors is a competitor’s ability to sleep at night. Even the strongest
Grandmasters need their energy to come through i n the homestretch.
In the martial arts world, this theme is also critical. The ability to wait for
hours on end without exploding with tension or losing your edge is often
what separates the top ﬁghters before they step in the ring. Big tournaments
involve a lot of downtime between matches. Some ﬁghters keep themselves in
a state of feverish alertness, always poised for action for fear their moment
might come and they won’t be ready. The more seasoned competitors relax,
listen to headpho nes, and nap. They don’t burn through their tanks before
stepping on the mats.
This phenomenon is not unique to the ﬁelds I have chosen. We don’t live
within a Hollywood screenplay where the crescendo erupts just when we want
it to, and more often than not the climactic moments in our lives will follow
many unclimactic, normal, humdrum hours, days, weeks, or years. So how do
we step up w hen our moment sudde nly arises?
My answer is to redeﬁne the question. Not only do we have to be good at
waiting, we have to love it. Because waiting is not waiting, it is life. Too
many of us live without fully engaging our minds, waiting for that moment
when our real lives begin. Years pass in boredom, but that is okay because
when our true love comes around, or we discover our real calling, we will
begin. Of course the sad truth is that if we are not present to the moment,
our true love could come and go and we wouldn’t even notice. And we will
have become someone other than the you or I who would be able to embrace
it. I believe an appreciation for simplicity, the everyday—the ability to dive
deeply into the banal and di scover life’s hidden richness—is where success, let
alone happiness, emerges.

Along these lines, when considering the issue of performance state, it is
important to avoid focusing on those rare climactic moments of high-stakes
competitive mayhem. If you get into a frenzy anticipating the moment that
will decide your destiny, then when it arrives you will be overwrought with
excitement and tension. To have success in crunch time, you need to integrate
certain healthy patterns into your day-to-day life so that they are completely
natural to you when the pressure is on. The real power of incremental growthcomes to bear when we truly are like water, steadily carving stone. We just
keep on ﬂowing w hen everything is on the line.
In recent years I have given many talks on performance psychology. At the
beginning of an event in Los Angeles a few years ago, I was approached by a
top Smith Barney producer, call him Dennis, who said he was having trouble
accessing a good performance state and often found himself distracted in
important meetings or unde r deadline. He asked my advice about how to
ﬁgure out what his “hot button” was. Dennis knew that some professional
athletes have routines that consistently put them into a good frame of mind
before competition. He just couldn’t ﬁnd the right routine. No matter how
hard he tried to discover the perfect song, meditative technique, stretching
exercise, or eating pattern, he just couldn’t make it work. Ideally, Dennis said
he would like to have a song that slipped him into the zone. Wha t should he
do?
This is a problem I have seen in many inconsistent performers. They are
frustrated and confused trying to ﬁnd an inspiring catalyst for peak
performance, as if the perfect motivational tool is hovering in the cosmos
waiting for discovery. My method is to work backward and create the trigger.
I asked Dennis when he felt closest to serene focus in his life. He thought for
a moment and told me it was when he played catch with his twelve-year-old
son, Jack. He fell into a blissful state when tossing a baseball with his boy,
and nothing else in the world seemed to exist. They played catch virtually
every day and Jack seemed to love it as much as his dad. Perfect.
I have observed that virtually all people have one or two activities that
move them in this manner, but they usually dismiss them as “just taking a
break.” If only they knew how valuable their breaks could be! Let me
emphasize that it doesn’t matter what your serene activity is. Whe ther you
feel most relaxed and focused while taking a bath, jogging, swimming,
listening to classical music, or singing in the shower, any such activity can
take the place of Dennis’s catch with his son.
The next step was to create a four- or ﬁve-step routine. Dennis had already
mentioned music, meditation, stretching, and eating. I sugge sted that an
hour before the next time he played catch with his son, Dennis should eat a
light snack. We decided on a blended fruit and soy shake that he enjoyed
making in his kitchen. Then he would go into a quiet room and do a ﬁfteen-
minute breathing exercise that he had learned a few years before. It was asimple meditative technique where he followed his breath. Whe n he noticed
his mind wandering, he just released the thought like a cloud gliding by and
returned to his breath. For beginners, this meditation may seem frustrating
because they notice their minds racing all over the place and feel that they are
doing badly; but that is not the case. The return to breath is the key to this
form of meditation. There is no doing badly or well, just being with your
breath, releasing your thoughts when you notice them, and coming back to
breath. I highly recommend such techniques. Not only is the return to breath
a glimmer of the zone—a moment of undistracted presence—but  the ebb and
ﬂow of the experience is another form of stress and recovery training. Finally,
if there is nothing in your life that feels serene, meditation is the perfect
hobby to help you discover a launching point in your search for a personalized
routine.
Dennis has had a light snack and done some breathing exercises. After
these twenty-ﬁve minutes, the next step would be a ten-minute stretching
routine from his high school football days. I asked Dennis what kind of music
he listened to. He had eclectic taste, everything from Metallica to Bob Dylan
to classical. I told him that I loved Bob Dylan as well. We decided on “Sad-
Eyed Lady of the Lowlands,” a beautiful, mellow, long Dylan song; but really
any music would have worked, depending on the individual’s preference.
After listening to the song, Dennis would get his son, and they would go
outside and toss around the baseball as they did every day. I told Dennis to
treat the catch like any other catch, just to have fun.
So we created the following routine:
1. Eat a light consistent snack for 10 m inutes
2. 15 m inutes of meditation
3. 10 m inutes of stretching
4. 10 m inutes of listening to Bob Dylan
5. Play ball
For about a month, Dennis went through his routine every day before
playing catch with his son. Each step of the routine was natural for him, and
playing ba ll was always a joy, so there was no strain to the experience.
The next step in the process is the critical one: after he had fully
internalized his routine, I sugge sted that he do it the morning before goingto an important meeting. So Dennis transplanted his routine from a prelude
to playing catch with his son to a prelude to work. He did so and came back
raving that he found himself in a totally serene state in what was normally a
stressful environment. He had no trouble being fully present througho ut the
meeting.
The point to this system of creating your own trigger is that a
physiological connection is formed between the routine and the activity it
precedes. Dennis was always present when playing ball with his son, so all we
had to do was set up a routine that became linked to that state of mind
(clearly it would have been impractical for Dennis to tow Jack around
everywhere he went). Once the routine is internalized, it can be used before
any activity and a similar state of mind will emerge. Let me emphasize that
your personal routine should be determined by your individual tastes. If
Dennis had so chosen, he could have done cartwheels, somersaults, screamed
into the wind, and then taken a swim before playing catch with his son, and
over time those activities would become physiologically connected to the
same state of mind. I tend to prefer a routine like Dennis’s, because it is
relatively portable and seems more conduc ive to a mellow presence, but to
each his own.
I have used routines before competitions for the last ten years of my life.
At chess tournaments, I would meditate for an hour while listening to a tape
that soothed me, and then I would go to war. Whe n I started competing in
the martial arts I already knew how to get into a peak performance state
unde r pressure and had little trouble dealing with less competitively
experienced opponents. Then I ran into a new problem.
In November 2000 I traveled to Taiwan to compete in my ﬁrst Push
Hands World Championship. I had never been to an international martial
arts tournament and was awed by the chanting fans in the bleachers and the
elaborate traditional opening ceremony in which thousands of competitors
marched with their countries’ ﬂags waving above. More than ﬁfty nations
were represented, each with a unique training style. While I watched the
other competitors warm up, I was impressed by their athleticism and obvious
mastery. The alien feeling of the environment seemed to heighten the threat
of my opponents. I was feeling off-balance so I went into my routine, which
at that point was a thirty-minute visualization exercise. I came out of itraring to go. It was 9:00 A.M., I was supposed to have one of the ﬁrst matches,
and I was ready to roll. Then the waiting be gan.
The clock passed 10:00, t hen 11:00. I  didn’t speak the langua ge and no  one
would tell me when I was scheduled to compete. I had heard that my
opponent was a Taiwanese star, but I had no idea what he looked like. I was
hungr y, but there was no food available at the arena and my teammates and I
had been unde r the impression that all ﬁrst-round matches would be early in
the morning, so we didn’t bring snacks—big mistake. I had been informed
that contestants would be announced over the loud speaker ﬁve minutes
before their match began, and if they failed to show up immediately they
would lose by forfeit. So I had to spend hours, hungr y, ready to go on
immediately for fear of leaving to eat a snack and getting thrown out of the
tournament.
Finally at noon a break in the action was announced. Lunc h boxes were
served to all competitors. At 12:15 I was given a greasy platter of pork fried
rice and duck. Far from ideal for the moment, but I was starving and had
little choice. So I ate. At 12:30 it was announced that I should report
immediately to the judge s’ table. I was informed my match was starting
immediately. My opponent was already warmed up, in a sweat, and had
clearly known the exact nature of the tournament schedule. I was
disconcerted, unprepared, and had a stomach full of greasy food. I got
destroyed. It wasn’t even close. It was a little bit of consolation to see my
opponent dominate the tournament and go on to win two consecutive World
Championships, but I hated the fact that I had traveled all the way to Taiwan
and had not even given myself a chance to compete. Some serious
adjustments were called for.
First of all, the nutritional side of this story is very important. I should
not have trusted the posted schedule and should have had something to
sustain me througho ut the wait, no matter how long it lasted. I had learned
from Jack Groppel at LGE to eat ﬁve almonds every forty-ﬁve minutes during
a long chess game, to stay in a steady state of alertness and strength. In
martial arts tournaments, I now tend to snack on Clif Bars, bananas, and
protein shakes whenever necessary. Or, if I know I have at least an hour, I
might have a bite of chicken or turkey. Only you know your own body, but
the key to nutrition in unpredictable environments like Taiwanese martialarts tournaments is to always be prepared for exertion by being nourished,
but never to have too full a stomach and thereby dull your senses.
The nutritional lesson is an easy one: I was careless and paid for it. But a
much more serious question arose: what good is a thirty- or forty-ﬁve-minute
routine if you only have minutes or seconds of warning before the big event?
In life, after all, things don’t always go according to schedule. Ideally we
should be able to click into the zone at a moment’s notice. This is where my
system for condensing the routine comes in.
Let’s return to Dennis. Whe re we left off, his routine was as follows:
1. Eat a light consistent snack for ten minutes
2. 15 m inutes of meditation
3. 10 m inutes of stretching
4. 10 m inutes of listening to Bob Dylan
He had already learned to export this routine from playing catch with his
son Jack, and could now go through the four steps before business meetings
or any other stressful event and be in a great state of mind througho ut.
Dennis loved the results and now did his routine before every meeting. He
had taken to scheduling important events right after lunch, so he had some
time alone to prepare. He felt great, was more productive, and loved the fresh
energy with which he was tackling anything he put his mind (and routine) to.
That’s already pretty good.
The next step of the process is to gradually alter the routine so that it is
similar enough so as to have the same physiological effect, but slightly
different so as to make the “trigger” both lower-maintenance and more
ﬂexible. The key is to make the changes incrementally, slowly, so there is more
similarity than difference from the last version of the routine. This way the
body and mind have the same physiological reaction even if the preparation is
slightly shorter.
Dennis started doing his routine every day before work, the only difference
being that he would eat a larger breakfast than the light snack, and he would
listen to Dylan during his short drive to the ofﬁce. Steps two and three took
place at home, after breakfast, as originally planned. Everything was going
beautifully.Next, for a few days, Dennis meditated for twelve minutes instead of
ﬁfteen. He still came out in the same great state of mind. Then he stretched
for eight minutes, instead of ten. Same presence. Then he changed the order
of the stretch and meditation. No problem. Over time, slowly but surely,
Dennis condensed his stretching and meditation routine down to just a few
minutes. Then he would listen to Bob Dylan and be ready to roll. If he wasn’t
hungr y, he could do without the snack altogether. His routine had been
condensed to around twelve minutes and was more potent than ever. Dennis
left it at that because he loved Dylan so much, but the next step would have
been to gradually listen to less and less music, until he only had to think
about the tune to click into the zone. This process is systematic,
straightforward, and rooted in the most stable of all principles: incremental
growth.
As for me, the Tai Chi meditative movements became my routine. Every
day before training at my dojo, we took about six minutes and “did the
form.” Then Push Hands class began, and a number of the top students went
at it with the same intensity with which we would approach competition. I
learned virtually everything I know about Tai Chi from my years of training
in that studio on 23rd Street. There is no place more peaceful and energizing
for me. So in addition to the stand-alone beneﬁts of Tai Chi meditation, my
body and mind learned to connect the form with my peak performance state
because I always did the form before training in my most inspiring setting.
But I did not leave it at that. I had learned that martial arts tournaments
are, if anything, unpredictable. We don’t always have ﬁve minutes of peace
and quiet before going to battle. After my disconcerting experience in the
2000 World Championships, I spent a number of months shortening the
amount of preparation I needed to be primed for the moment. The essence of
the Tai Chi meditative movements is the continued gathering and release of
body and mind as the practitioner ﬂows through the various martial postures.
As I inhale, my mind comes alive, and I visualize energizing from my feet
into my ﬁnge rs. Whe n I exhale, the mind relaxes, the body de-energizes, lets
go, winds up, and prepares for the next inﬂation. In essence, if you ignore the
concrete strengths of the various postures, Tai Chi meditation is the practice
of ebb and ﬂow, soft and hard, yin and yang, change. So in theory I should be
able to condense the practice to its essence.Incrementally, I started shortening the amount of form I did before
starting my training. I did a little less than the whole form, then 3/4 of it,
1/2, 1/4. Over the course of many months, utilizing the incremental approach
of small changes, I trained myself to be completely prepared after a deep
inhalation and release. I also learned to do the form in my mind without
moving at all. The visualization proved almost as powerful as the real thing.
This idea is not without precedent—recall the numbers to leave numbers, form to
leave form, and Making Smaller Circles discussions in Part II. At a high level,
principles can be internalized to the point that they are barely recognizable
even to the most skilled observers.
I now handle the unpredictability of martial arts tournaments with ease.
In fact, the more adverse the environment, the better off I feel, because I
know my opponents will not deal with the chaos as well as I will. Whe n I
arrive in the tournament hall I get a rough sense for when things will begin.
Then I do the Tai Chi form a couple of times, so my body is loose and
ﬂowing. I relax, eat a little at a time so I am ready on a moment’s notice. If
they call my name and say I must report immediately, I go through as much
or as little of a routine as I have time for, and I’m good to go. No problem.
The ideal for any performer is ﬂexibility. If you have optimal conditions, then
it is always great to take your time and go through an extended routine. If
things are less organized, then be prepared with a ﬂexible state of mind and a
condensed routine.
Of course the advantages to such condensing practice extend far beyond
the professional or competitive arenas. If you are driving your car, crossing
the street, or doing any other munda ne activity, and are sudde nly confronted
by a potentially dangerous situation, if you are trained to perform optimally
on a moment’s notice, then you may emerge unscathed from some hair-
raising situations. But far more critical than these rare climactic explosions, I
believe that this type of condensing practice can do wonders to raise our
quality of life. Once a simple inhalation can trigger a state of tremendous
alertness, our moment-to-moment awareness becomes blissful, like that of
someone half-blind who puts on glasses for the ﬁrst time. We see more as we
walk down the street. The everyday becomes exquisitely beautiful. The notion
of boredom becomes alien and absurd as we naturally soak in the lovely
subtleties of the “banal.” All experiences become richly intertwined by our
new vision, and then new connections begin to emerge. Rainwater streamingon a city pavement will teach a pianist how to ﬂow. A leaf gliding easily with
the wind will teach a controller how to let go. A housecat will teach me how
to move. All moments become each moment. This book is about learning and
performance, but it is also about my life. Presence has taught me how to live.CHAPTER 18
MAKING SANDALS
To walk a thorny road, we may cover its every inch with leather or we can make sandals.
Anger. Fear. Desperation. Excitement. Happiness. Despair. Hope. Emotions
are part of our lives. We would be fools to deny such a rich element of the
human experience. But, when our emotions overwhelm us, we can get sloppy.
If fear reduces us to tears, we might not act effectively in a genuinely
dangerous situation. If we seethe when someone crosses us, we may make
decisions we come to regret. If we get giddy when things are looking up, we
will probably make some careless mistakes that turn our good situation
upside down.
Competitors have different ways of approaching their emotions in the heat
of battle. Many either feel that their natural movements are irrepressible or
fail to consider the question altogether. These are not ideal approaches—if we
don’t think the issue through, chances are we will be controlled by our
passions. There are performers who recognize the disruptive potential of
emotions and try to turn them off, become cold, detached, steely. For some
personalities this might work, although in my opinion denial tends to melt
down when the pressure becomes ﬁerce. Then there are those elite performers
who use emotion, observing their moment and then channeling everything
into a deeper focus that generates a uniquely ﬂavored creativity. This is an
interesting, resilient approach based on ﬂexibility and subtle introspective
awareness. Instead of being bullied by or denying their unconscious, these
players let their internal movements ﬂavor their ﬁres.Over the years, at various stages of my development, I have found myself
all over this spectrum. In time, I have come to believe that this last style,
rooted in my notions of The Soft Zone and The Internal Solution, is a potent
launching point for a unique approach to performance. In this chapter, I’ll
focus on one of the most decisive emotions, one that can make or break a
competitor: Anger. As we enter into this discussion, please keep in mind the
three steps I described as being critical to resilient, self-sufﬁcient
performance. First, we learn to ﬂow with distraction, like that blade of grass
bending to the wind. Then we learn to use distraction, inspiring ourselves
with what initially would have thrown us off our games. Finally we learn to
re-create the inspiring settings internally. We learn to make sandals.
My own experience with anger in competition began with being jerked
around by a rival of mine whom I mentioned in Part I of the book. This kid
was a huge ly talented Russian player who immigrated to the U.S. when we
were ﬁfteen years old. Immediately he and I were the top two young players
in the country. Boris knew how to push my buttons. He was unrestrained by
any notion of competitive etiquette or even by the rules. He would do
everything it took to win, and would sometimes do things so far outside the
lines of normal chess behavior that I was totally taken aback. Consider the
hilarity of this moment. We are in the U.S. Junior Championship, last round,
playing for the title. I am four or ﬁve minutes into a deep thought process.
This is the critical position. The ideas are coming together, I’m approaching a
solution, and sudde nly Boris kicks me unde r the table, two or three times,
hard. Boris studied karate and I know he liked to kick things, but this was
ridiculous.
There were many times that Boris pummeled me unde r the table during
critical moments of our games, but of course not all of his tactics were so
over-the-top. He would shake the board, loudly clear his throat in my face
ﬁve or six times a minute, tap pieces on the table while I tried to think, or
confer about the position in Russian with his coach. The standard reaction to
such moments is to go tell the arbiter what is happening. T he problem is that
when this happened Boris would feign innocence, insist in Russian and
broken English that he had no idea what I was talking about, and the arbiter
would have nothing to go with. Even if Boris was reprimanded, he had
succeeded in getting my mind off the position. He was winning the
psychological battle.I found Boris’s disregard for sportsmanship infuriating. People like him
hurt the game that I loved. I mentioned in Part I that we both traveled to a
world championship in India to represent the United States, and several
teams lodged formal protests against the American team because he and his
coach were blatantly cheating througho ut the event. The whole situation
made me sick. The problem is that it also made me angry.
Time and again in critical moments of our games, Boris would pull out
some dirty trick, and I would get irritated and make an error. To his credit,
Boris knew how to get in my head. As a teenager, anger clouded my vision
and Boris played me like a drum. After losing a couple of games to him, I
realized that righteous indignation would get me nowhere. I decided to block
my anger out. When Boris tapped pieces, I took a deep breath. Whe n he
talked about the position with his coach, I just played knowing I would have
to beat both of them. Whe n Boris shook the board, I ignored him. This
might have seemed a good strategy, but the problem with this approach is
that Boris didn’t have a limit. He was perfectly content to escalate the
situation (for example by leg kick combinations) and eventually I would get
pissed off and have a meltdown. It took me some time to realize that
blocking out my natural emotions was not the solution. I had to learn to use
my moment organically. Instead of being thrown off by or denying my
irritation, I had to somehow channel it into a profound state of concentration.
It wasn’t until my martial arts career that I really learned how to do this.
It took work. The ﬁrst time this issue came up in my competitive martial
arts life was in the ﬁnals of my ﬁrst Tai Chi Chuan Push Hands National
Championship in November 2000. I had cruised through the tournament
thus far and was in the lead in this match until my opponent head-butted me
in the nose, which is blatantly illegal. The referee didn’t see it and play
continued. The rules of this particular tournament were that points were
scored when someone was unba lanced and either thrown into the air, on the
ground, or out of a large ring. No blows to the neck, head, or groin were
allowed. About ﬁfteen seconds later he head-butted me again, harder, and a
wild surge of anger ﬂew up through my body and into my eyes. The blood
rush to the eyes that comes with a hard blow to the nose is, I believe, where
the expression “seeing red” comes from. I saw red and went out of control for
about ten seconds. On the video it looks like my methodical style somehow
mutated into a bullish madness. I was over-aggressive, off-balance andcompletely vulnerable—qui te literally, I was blinded by rage. I almost lost
the Nationals in those moments, but fortunately I returned to my senses and
was able to win the match. A weakness of mine was exposed and luckily I
didn’t have to lose to learn.
This experience was disturbing to me on a number of levels. There is the
competitive angle, but for me there was also a much more important idea at
stake. My relationship to the martial arts is rooted in nonviolence. I don’t get
into ﬁghts. I don’t want to hurt anyone. I believe that our world is destroying
itself with a cycle of violence begetting violence, and I don’t want to have any
part in that cycle. I ﬁrst got involved with Tai Chi Chuan as a movement
away from ego, away from ﬁghting. I was drawn to the experience of harmony
and interconnectedness that felt like a counterpoint to the dog-eat-dog chess
world. As I got deeper into the martial side of Tai Chi, and later the
grappling art Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, this inner harmony would be tested
continuously. To some this might seem like a contradiction—w hy step into a
martial arts ring if you don’t want to ﬁght? My personal relationship to this
question involves continuous internal cultivation. It is easy to speak of
nonviolence when I am in a ﬂower garden. The real internal challenge is to
maintain that funda mental perspective when confronted by hostility,
aggression, and pain. The next step in my growth process would be to stay
true to myself unde r increasingly difﬁcult conditions.
For the year following this incident at the Nationals, I devoted myself to
staying principled when sparring with creeps. I sought out dirty players and
got better and better at keeping cool when they got out of control. There
were a couple of guys in particular who were very useful to me in this
training. I’m sure you remember Evan, the big fellow from the Investment in
Loss chapter, who used to throw me against the wall. He wasn’t a bad guy, but
he always pushed me to my limit with his aggression. Much of our training
took place during this period of time.
There was another fellow I’ll call Frank who was much more of the
genuine article. He had been a big Push Hands competitor for a number of
years and he didn’t like to lose. When he was having trouble, he got dirty. He
made his own rules. His particular method of choice was to attack the neck.
In Push Hands the target area is shoulders to waist. Bare-handed attacks to
the neck can be quite dangerous, and it is normal training etiquette not to
target the neck at all. But whenever Frank felt threatened or unstable, hewould start jabbing ﬁnge rs at the Adam’s apple. I had one or two ugly
experiences with Frank doing this when I was a beginner, well before the
Nationals head-butt scene. I didn’t like his vibe, felt he was out of control,
and for the most part avoided training w ith him.
Now that changed. I had an issue to work on and Frank would be the ideal
training partner. The ﬁrst step I had to make was to recognize that the
problem was mine, not Frank’s. There will always be creeps in the world, and
I had to learn how to deal with them with a cool head. Getting pissed off
would get me nowhere in life.
Once I started training w ith Frank again, I quickly realized that the reason
I got angry when he went after my neck was that I was scared. I didn’t know
how to handle it and thought I would get hurt. He was playing outside of the
rules so a natural defense mechanism of mine was anger and righteous
indignation. Just like with Boris. So, ﬁrst things ﬁrst—I had to learn to deal
with neck attacks. There was a period of months that I asked a few
trustworthy training partners of mine to target my neck in Push Hands class.
I got used to neutralizing these attacks. Then whenever Frank came into the
school, I sought him out and we worked together. Whe never he felt me
controlling him, he predictably started going after my neck. Whe n this
didn’t work, he’d expand his target area, sometimes aiming at an eye, knee, or
the groin. My goal was to stay cool unde r increasingly bad conditions.
After a year of this training, I went back to San Diego to defend my title
at the Nationals. Predictably enough, in the ﬁnals I faced off with the same
guy as the year before. The opening phase of the match was similar to our
previous meeting. I began by controlling him, neutralizing his aggression,
building up a lead. Then he got emotional and started throwing head-butts.
My reaction was very different this time. Instead of getting mad, I just rolled
with his attacks and threw him out of the ring. His tactics didn’t touch me
emotionally, and when unclouded, I was simply at a much higher level than
him. It was amazing ho w easy it all felt when I didn’t take the bait.
There were two components to this work. One related to my approach to
learning, the other to performance. On the learning side, I had to get
comfortable dealing with guys playing outside the rules and targeting my
neck, eyes, groin, etc. This involved some technical growth, and in order to
make those steps I had to recognize the relationship between anger, ego, and
fear. I had to develop the habit of taking on my technical weaknesseswhenever someone pushed my limits instead of falling back into a self-
protective indignant pose. Once that adjustment was made, I was free to
learn. If someone got into my head, they were doing me a favor, exposing a
weakness. They were giving me a valuable opportunity to expand my
threshold for turbulence. Dirty players were my best teachers.
On the performance side, I had made some strides, but still had a long w ay
to go. First of all, I had to keep my head on straight no matter what. But this
was only the initial step of the process. The fact of the matter is that we have
our natural responses to situations for a reason. Feelings of anger and fear and
elation emerge from deep inside of us and I think blocking them out is an
artiﬁcial habit. In my experience, competitors who make this mistake tend to
crumble when pus hed far enough.
I recall reading a New York Times article about the New York Jets
placekicker Doug Brien days before the Jets took on the Pittsburgh Steelers
in the 2004 NFL playoffs. Brien talked conﬁde ntly about going into a
meditative place before every kick. He said that he isolated himself from his
surroundings, and he claimed that even unde r huge  pressures his mind was
“completely empty” before each kick. Whe n I saw this I felt suspicious about
his process—the “completely” bothered me—and I called my dad and told
him I was worried about our kicker. Sure enough, when the Jets took on the
Steelers, everything came down to two critical kicks. The ﬁrst one Brien
kicked short. The second he shanked way left. In an interview right after the
game he said that after the ﬁrst miss all he could think about was getting it
long enough. One miss combined with big pressure to jolt Brien out of his
perfect calm: he ﬁxated on his last mistake and was anything but empty-
minded. The fact of the matter is that while I love meditation and believe
wholeheartedly in training oneself to operate calmly unde r pressure, there is a
difference between the practice ﬁeld and a hostile, freezing-cold stadium
ﬁlled with screaming fans who want you to fail in the biggest moment of
your life. The only way to succeed is to acknowledge reality and funne l it,
take the nerves and use them. We must be prepared for imperfection. If we
rely on having no nerves, on not being thrown off by a big miss, or on the
exact replication of a certain mindset, then when the pressure is high enough,
or when the pain is too piercing to ignore, our ideal state will shatter.
The Soft Zone approach is much more organic and useful than denial. The
next steps of my growth would be to do with anger what I had withdistraction years before. Instead of denying my emotional reality unde r ﬁre, I
had to learn how to sit with it, use it, channel it into a heightened state of
intensity. Like the earthqua ke and the broken hand, I had to turn my
emotions to my advantage.

It has been my observation that the greatest performers convert their passions
into fuel with tremendous consistency. There are examples in every
discipline. For basketball fans, think about the Reggie Miller/Spike Lee saga.
Lee is New York’s No. 1 Knicks fan. Reggie Miller was the star of the Indiana
Pacers from 1987 to 2005. Througho ut the 1990s , the Knicks and Pacers
repeatedly met in the playoffs and Lee would be sitting in his courtside seat
in Madison Square Garden for every home game. Time and again he would
heckle Miller until Miller started to respond. At ﬁrst this looked like a good
situation to Knicks fans. Spike was distracting Reggie from the game.
Sometimes it seemed that Reggie was paying more attention to Spike than to
the Knicks. But then it became apparent that Miller was using Lee as fuel for
his ﬁre. Over and over, Reggie would banter with Spike while torching the
Knicks with unbe lievable shooting. After a while Knicks fans just hoped
Spike would shut up. T he lesson had been learned—do n’t piss off Reggie.
Incidentally, young NBA players learned the same lesson during the
Michael Jordan era. Jordan was a notorious trash talker on the court. He
would goad defenders into dialogue, but the problem was that if you talked
back it inspired Jordan to blow you off the court. The only thing to do was to
let Jordan talk and play your game. Try to keep some of the beast asleep.
Then he would just score his thirty points and move on to the next game. But
if you woke the beast, Mike would score ﬁfty and then do it again next time
you played him.
A few years ago I was talking with Keith Hernandez about the role of
anger in his career. For those who are not big sports fans, Keith was a
dominant force with the St. Louis Cardinals and then the New York Mets,
playing Major League Baseball from 1974 to 1990. Keith won 11 Gold Glove
awards, won the batting title and National League Most Valuable Player
Award in 1979, and led the Mets to victory in the historic 1986 World Seriesagainst the Boston Red Sox. Hernandez is known as one of the toughe st
hitters in baseball history.
I asked Keith how he dealt with pitchers throwing at him. A pitcher will
sometimes either hit a batter or come very close to hitting a batter with a
pitch in order to plant a psychological seed. Getting nailed by a 90-mph
fastball is not a pleasant experience, and many serious injuries have come out
of this dark gamesmanship. The infamous scenes of hitters charging the
mound and clubho uses emptying into terrible brawls are usually the result of
a batter feeling that he is being targeted.
If the batter is actually hit, he automatically gets on ﬁrst base—as if he
were walked. This is obviously less than great for a pitcher, but it is a
calculated decision, because many batters will get psyched out by being
pelted—a nd they will be scared at the plate for the rest of the game or even
for years when facing that pitcher. Knowing that the fastball might be tailing
toward your head complicates the hitting experience, and many batters get
intimidated. Or they get mad. Either way, if a pitcher feels that he can get in
your head by throwing at you, in Keith’s words, “You’ll be on your butt!”
For Keith, pitchers dug their own graves by targeting him. He explains:
“That was always a positive motivational thing for me; if a pitcher knocked
me down or hit me on purpose, well by golly you’ve got your hands full for
the rest of the year with me. Particularly the rest of this game.” Over the
years pitchers learned to stay away from Keith, be cause they would be rousing
a giant by hitting hi m.
Keith told me a story about Frank Robinson, one of the all-time greatest
baseball players, and the only man to be MVP of both the American League
and the National League. Robinson began his career in Cincinnati back in
1956. In those days pitchers threw at batters all the time. The Reds were
playing a three-game series against St. Louis, and in the ﬁrst game, Robinson
got hit by a pitch and went on to have a phenomenal night. The next day the
pitcher hit Robinson again, and he just destroyed the Cardinals througho ut
the whole series. A week later, the two teams played another series, but before
it began Red Schoendienst, the St. Louis manager—and Keith’s ﬁrst manager
—called a team meeting and said “The ﬁrst pitcher who hits Frank Robinson
is ﬁned one hundr ed bucks! Just leave him alone!” Keith loves this story. It
represents what a truly dominant competitor should be all about. Guys likeMiller, Jordan, Hernandez, and Robinson are so far beyond shakable that
opponents, instead of playing m ental games, cower for fear of inspiring them.
*  *  *
Returning to my own experience, I have steadily worked on integrating my
natural emotions into creative states of inspiration. Of course there were
stages to this process. As a teenager I was thrown off by emotion and tried to
block it out. Then, in my early twenties, during my initial experiments with
Buddhi st and Taoist meditation, I worked on letting my emotions pass like a
cloud. This was interesting as it opened up a working relationship with my
emotional reality very much like how I described working with the
unconscious in the chapter Slowing Down Time. Instead of being dominated by
or denying my passions, I slowly learned how to observe them and feel how
they infused my moment with creativity, freshness, or darkness.
Once I had a working relationship with my emotions, I began to take on
my psychological reaction to foul play in the martial arts with a bit more
subtlety. I believe that at the highest levels, performers and artists must be
true to themselves. There can be no denial, no repression of true personality,
or else the creation will be false—the performer will be alienated from his or
her intuitive voice. I am a passionate guy. The fact of the matter is that I
don’t particularly like dirty players. Their relationships to competition, to
ego, to sport, to art, to violence, to foul play—it all rubs me the wrong w ay.
The next step in my training would be to channel my gut reaction into
intensity. This is not so hard once you get comfortable in that heated-up
place. It is more about sweeping away the cobwebs than about learning
anything new. We are built to be sharpest when in danger, but protected lives
have distanced us from our natural abilities to channel our energies. Instead
of running from our emotions or being swept away by their initial gusts, we
should learn to sit with them, become at peace with their unique ﬂavors, and
ultimately discover deep pools of inspiration. I have found that this is a
natural process. Once we build our tolerance for turbulence and are no longer
upended by the swells of our emotional life, we can ride them and even pick
up speed with their slopes.
For a period following that second National Championship, I worked on
myself. First I learned to stay cool when training with dirty players, and thenI started to use my passion to my advantage, to use my natural heat. Whe n
working with guys who got out of control, I would feel an organic change in
my body chemistry. While initially this may have been disorienting, now I
used it to sharpen my game, up the intensity, funne l my primal heat into a
penetrating focus. I was no longer being governed by self-protectiveness and
fear, and so there was no disorienting anger. In time, I discovered that instead
of being thrown off by the likes of Frank, I played my best against them.
My next competitive experience with a dirty player was in the 2002 Push
Hands World Championship in Taiwan. Early in my ﬁrst round of the
tournament, the Austrian representative, a noticeably unpleasant man,
delivered an entirely illegal and quite painful uppe r cut to my groin. He was
a highly skilled martial artist and I was in a lot of pain—but  it was
astonishing how his antics backﬁred. I smiled at him, and he cursed at me. I
felt no anger, just resolve. As the match continued, he kept on trying to get
in my head in every way imaginable. He went for my groin, tried to take out
my knee, continued to attack well after the referee had called stoppages. I
didn’t react except to buckle down. Every dirty move made me just a little
steelier, and what was interesting was that the less his rage affected me, the
more ﬂustered he got. He became increasingly aggressive. His failure to get
in my head consumed him, made him crazy, and as he got more and more
heated he lost track of the technical side of the game and I picked apart his
overextensions. This guy was used to rattling opponents with foul play, and
by being unmoved, I turned his tactics against him. He landed one cheap
shot, but I knocked him out of the tournament.
*  *  *
Of course there is an array of emotions beyond anger that can emerge in
pressured scenarios. Truly superb competitive psychologists are ﬁnely attuned
to their diverse moods and to the creative potential born of them. The former
World Chess Champion Tigran Petrosian was known by his rivals to have a
peculiar way of handling this issue. Whe n he was playing long matches that
lasted over the course of weeks or even months, he would begin each day by
waking up and sitting quietly in his room for a period of introspection. His
goal was to observe his mood down to the ﬁnest nuance. Was he feeling
nostalgic, energetic, cautious, dreary, impassioned, inspired, conﬁde nt,insecure? His next step was to build his game plan around his mood. If he
was feeling cautious, quiet, not overwhelmingly conﬁde nt, he tended to
choose an opening that took fewer risks and led to a position that harmonized
with his disposition. If feeling energized, aggressive, exceedingly conﬁde nt,
he would pick an opening that allowed him to express himself in a more
creative vein. There were countless subtle variations of mood and of opening.
Instead of imposing an artiﬁcial structure on his match strategy, Petrosian
tried to be as true to himself as possible on a moment-to-moment basis. He
believed that if his mood and the chess position were in synch, he would be
most inclined to play with the greatest inspiration.
Garry Kasparov, World Chess Champion for nearly twenty years and
perhaps the strongest chess player of all time, had a different approach to his
emotions. Kasparov was a ﬁercely aggressive chess player who thrived on
energy and conﬁde nce. My father wrote a book called Mortal Games about
Garry, and during the years surrounding the 1990 Kasparov-Karpov match,
we both spent quite a lot of time with him. At one point, after Kasparov had
lost a big game and was feeling dark and fragile, my father asked Garry how
he would handle his lack of conﬁde nce in the next game. Garry responded
that he would try to play the chess moves that he would have played if he
were feeling conﬁde nt. He would pretend to feel conﬁde nt, and hopefully
trigger the state. Kasparov was an intimidator over the board. Everyone in
the chess world was afraid of Garry and he fed on that reality. If Garry
bristled at the chessboard, opponents would wither. So if Garry was feeling
bad, but puffed up his chest, made aggressive moves, and appeared to be the
manifestation of Conﬁde nce itself, then opponents would become unsettled.
Step by step, Garry would feed off his own chess moves, off the created
position, and off his opponents’ building fear, until soon enough the
conﬁde nce would become real and Garry would be in ﬂow. If you think back
to the chapter Building Your Trigger and apply it to this description, you’ll see
that Garry was not pretending. He was not being artiﬁcial. Garry was
triggering hi s zone by playing K asparov chess.
As you can see, there are many different approaches to handling your
emotions unde r ﬁre. Some are better than others, and at the high end perhaps
your personality should determine the nuance of your ﬁne-tuning decisions.
That said, I highly recommend that you incorporate the principles of Building
Your Trigger into your process. Once you are no longer swept away by youremotions and can sit with them even when unde r pressure, you will probably
notice that certain states of mind inspire you more than others. For some it
may be happiness, for others it may be fear. To each his own. Petrosian was
very ﬂexible. Miller, Hernandez, and Robinson worked well with anger.
Kasparov and Jordan were intimidators: they inspired themselves by wilting
opponents. Once you unde rstand where you lie on this spectrum, the next
step is to become self-sufﬁcient by creating your own inspiring conditions.
Kasparov triggered his zone by acting conﬁde nt and then creating the
conditions on the chessboard and a dynamic with his opponent in which he
played his best. Miller talked with Spike Lee until he got ﬁred up. Whe n
Spike wasn’t around, Reggie still liked to play the bad guy. In fact he was at
his very best in the playoffs on the road, competing in a stadium ﬁlled with
hostile fans. If the fans weren’t hostile, he might goad them into hating him.
Reggie thrived as the villain and triggered these conditions whenever he
needed a boost.
But how do you play your best when there is no one around to provide
motivation? There is no cookie-cutter mold to inspiration. There is, however,
a process we can follow to discover our unique path. First, we cultivate The
Soft Zone, we sit with our emotions, observe them, work with them, learn how
to let them ﬂoat away if they are rocking our boat, and how to use them when
they are fueling our creativity. Then we turn our weaknesses into strengths
until there is no denial of our natural eruptions and nerves sharpen our game,
fear alerts us, anger funne ls into focus. Next we discover what emotional
states trigger our greatest performances. This is truly a personal question.
Some of us will be most creative when ebullient, others when morose. To each
his own. Introspect. Then Make Sandals, become your own earthqua ke, Spike
Lee, or tailing fastball. Discover what states work best for you and, like
Kasparov, build condensed triggers so you can pull from your deepest
reservoirs of creative inspiration at will.CHAPTER 19
BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER
Learners and performers come in all shapes and sizes. Some people are
aggressive, others are cautious. Some of us like questions, others prefer
answers. Some bubbl e with conﬁde nce, always hunge ring for a challenge,
while others break into a sweat at the notion of taking on something new.
Most of us are a complicated mix of greys. We have areas of stability and
others in which we are wobbly. In my experience the greatest of artists and
competitors are masters of navigating their own psychologies, playing on
their strengths, controlling the tone of battle so that it ﬁts with their
personalities. While in this book I have conveyed my vision of a life of
learning, it is my hope that you will take these ideas and make them your
own. Make them ﬁt with your natural disposition. I have found that in the
intricate endeavors of competition, learning, and performance, there is more
than one solution to virtually every meaningful problem. We are unique
individuals who should put  our own ﬂair into everything w e do.
The question is: How do we do this? Let’s say we have become very good at
something, and we are capable of performing reliably unde r pressure. How do
we become exceptional? How do we make that leap from technical virtuosity
to unique creativity? The real art in learning takes place as we move beyond
proﬁciency, when our work becomes an expression of our essence. This was the
challenge at the center of my preparation for the 2004 Chung Hwa Cup, the
World Championships of Tai Chi Chuan Push Hands. Wha t was it inside that
could take me to the top?
Whe n I think back on the arc of my competitive Tai Chi life, Taiwan was
always the reality check. It was the true measure of my growth. The skill
level in U.S. Push Hands events, including our championships, doesn’tcompare to such competitions in Taiwan, where Push Hands is the national
sport. Mediocrity can be self-nurturing, and frankly, many U.S. Push Hands
players delude themselves about their level of proﬁciency. The top Taiwanese
ﬁghters train for many hours a day from childhood, constantly competing in
brutal regional and national tournaments. For the summer before the
biannua l Chung  Hwa Cup, the elite schools have training camps where
ﬁghters up the intensity of their preparation, working six or eight hours a
day, combining intense conditioning with technical sharpening. The stakes
are very high for these competitors, and they are well-oiled machines when
they step in the ring. Foreigners traveling to the Chung Hwa Cup are
entering the den of the lion. Win in Taiwan and then we can talk about
greatness.
The ﬁrst time I traveled to Taiwan, in 2000, I was fresh off winning my
ﬁrst Push Hands National Championship. In more ways than one, I had no
idea what I was getting myself into. I described in Building Your Trigger how I
got blindsided by the scheduling of the event. I was told my ﬁrst match
would be early in the morning but I was faced with hours of waiting. I got
increasingly hungr y and had nothing to eat. Whe n the lunch break was
announced at noon, I devoured a greasy platter and was immediately called to
the ring. I got blown out of the water by the guy who went on to win the
tournament. While I certainly needed to take on the psychological side of
what happened to have any chance to compete unde r these conditions, the
truth of the matter is that it was not the decisive factor. My opponent was
much better than me. If I had been perfectly poised, he would have beaten
me. I had a lot to learn.
In the two years following my ﬁrst experience in Taiwan, I really buckled
down in my training. I’ve described much of that work in the early chapters
of Part II, but there was also another component to this preparation. Chinese
martial arts tend to be very secretive, and Tai Chi Chuan is a particularly
enigmatic discipline. If you read the Tai Chi Classics, study the philosophical
founda tion, practice the moving meditation, you will gain a sense of
awareness, feel supple, and possibly be able to generate a lot of speed and
power. But it is hard to translate these principles into viable martial
application until you test yourself out in the ring and incrementally separate
the real from the mythical. Unfortunately, many teachers haven’t done this
themselves, and they protect their egos and their schools by claiming to havetremendous power—for example, the ability to throw someone without
touching them—but  they refuse to show anyone. Often, suppo sedly great
martial artists will avoid demonstrating their “power” by offering the
explanation: “If you and I were to spar, I might kill you.” Whe never I hear
this I know that I am listening to a charlatan—true masters have control. On
the other hand, some very powerful skills really can be developed and it is
true that the greatest secrets are kept for a very select circle. There is always
the lingering que stion—w hat is really possible and w hat is hype?
Until I went to Taiwan, I had no idea what to expect. And sure enough, t he
top competitors were armed with a skill set I had never dreamed of. They
were remarkable athletes who had grown up in a culture that cultivated the
reﬁnement of Push Hands in the same way that the old Soviet Union had
mastered the engineering of great chess players. Following that ﬁrst
tournament, I was armed with direct observation and many hours of video of
the toughe st Push Hands players in the world. That video footage of the top
Taiwanese competitors would prove to be a crucial well of information.
After my ﬁrst trip to Taiwan, I saw that the greatest practitioners were not
mystics, but profoundly dedicated martial artists who had reﬁned certain
funda mental skills at a tremendously high level. The subtlety of their
unba lancing techniques was sometimes mind-boggling. While an untrained
eye might have seen nothing, these players were using incredibly potent
combinations designed to provoke the tiniest of leans—and then opponents
were on the ﬂoor. From 2000 to 2002, I studied these tapes in detail and
slowly reﬁned my game. During those years much of my training was with
my dear friend Tom Otterness, who is William Chen’s senior student and one
of the most powerful internal martial artists I have ever known. Tom is a
sculptor who spends his days molding clay and who subsequently has hands
and arms that feel like a bear’s—add over thirty-ﬁve years of Tai Chi training
and it’s no surprise that Tom hits like an avalanche. Whe n Tom and I ﬁrst
started working together, he would smash me all over the ring. I felt like a
tennis ball meeting a wall of force, and to make matters worse Tom was also a
heat-seeking missile—there was no avoiding his power. I was forced to add
subtlety to my neutralizations and to build up my rootI so I could survive his
onslaughts. Working with Tom night after night gave me the conﬁde nce that
I could stand in the ring w ith anyone.Whe n I went back to the Chung  Hwa Cup in late November 2002, I was
ready, or so I thought. By now I had won the U.S. Nationals for three straight
years. I regularly competed in multiple weight categories, often giving up
over a hundr ed pounds to my opponents and consistently winning
heavyweight and super-heavyweight titles. I was a much improved martial
artist and I also knew what I was getting myself into. My ﬁrst match of that
2002 Chung Hwa Cup was against the Austrian representative, who had just
won the European Championship a few months before the Worlds. I described
in the previous chapter how early in the match he nailed me with an uppe r
cut to the groin. He was a dirty player who counted on getting into his
opponents’ heads, but a large part of my training the previous couple of years
had been focused on handling his ilk. I buckled down and knocked him out of
the tournament.
My next match was against the top student of one of the Taiwanese
schools. He was slippery, very fast, but he had a bad habit of rooting off his
rear leg when pressured. As I mentioned in The Illusion of the Mystical, the
problem with putting your weight too far back is that when it shifts forward,
as it must inevitably, there is an opening—a  ﬂash when you are vulnerable. I
had been working very hard on my throws for the previous two years, and I
was able to work him toward the edge of the ring, make him lean on me, and
then use his momentum to put him on the ground. His habitual weight
distribution served as a tell and I was all over him. I won the match easily.
Now came the semiﬁnals and my opponent was a Taiwanese star. His name
was Chen Ze-Cheng and he was the guy I had been most impressed with two
years before. In fact, the video footage I had focused on most closely while
preparing for this year’s tournament was of Chen Ze-Cheng dismantling his
opponents. Chen has the physicality of a gazelle. Tall, sinewy, incredibly
strong for his weight, and dazzlingly athletic, he puts opponents on the ﬂoor
with a speed and technical virtuosity that just bafﬂes the mind. He is the son
of the top Push Hands teacher in Taiwan, who is also arguably the best trainer
in the world, and so in addition to his physical gifts Chen had been receiving
the very best instruction since childhood.
Whe n the opening bell rang, I was all charged up. Our wrists met in the
middle of the ring and he immediately shot in for a throw, which I crimped.
But he kept the pressure on, pummeling in with his hands to get an
advantageous grappling po sition. I felt danger everywhere. I kept on brushinghim away from me, staving off throw after throw, but he wouldn’t stop
coming. His power felt internal, relaxed, molten, and always primed for an
explosion. He was all over me, relentless—but  he still hadn’t scored any
points. A little over halfway through the ﬁrst round I caught him off-balance
in the middle of one of his attacks and exploded into a huge  push that sent
him ﬂying. It looked like Chen was going out of the ring, but he landed with
his toes still in, heels hovering over the line, and he did a matrix maneuver,
head backwards nearly to the ﬂoor while he pushed out with his waist to keep
his balance and stay in bounds. Such an athlete! I charged into the attack but
just when I arrived he was upright again and somehow rooted. This was a war.
Playing in that ring with Chen I had the feeling that he was in my skin,
sucking out my energy. I kept on pushing him away like a bad dream. I
would unbalance him a little, weather his storms, but his conditioning was
amazing and he kept coming back. With about thirty seconds to go in the
round, I started to feel drained. I have come to unde rstand that this is a big
part of Chen’s strategy—he  pressures opponents, nags them. He is looking for
openings but really just goading rivals into exhausting themselves by
pushing him away. He keeps pummeling in, getting pushed back, and
returning with an endless persistence. I felt this happening and decided to
stay in the clinch for a minute, let him in, see if he could do anything. I was
on the ﬂoor before I could blink.
It was a stunning throw. I was up and then I was down, and I didn’t know
what hit me. I got up shaking my head and came back at him. There wasn’t
much time left, and I was overaggressive and got taken down again. The
second round was more of the same. He pressured me, I staved him off,
searched for openings, but for the most part he felt like a martial giant.
About a minute into the round, he caught me ﬂat-footed and the next thing I
knew I was piling face ﬁrst into the mats. Man was he fast! Then he just held
me off, protecting his lead. I went after him and was in the middle of a wild
attack, a desperate attempt to come back when the bell rang and the match
was over. We hugge d. He had beaten me with grace and true excellence. My
neck and shoulder were throbbing in pain. I was wrecked. I had one more
match in the tournament—a ﬁght for third place, which I somehow managed
to win despite hardly being able to move the right side of my upper body. So
I took bronze in the tournament and had two more years to stew in my juices
until my next chance. The bar had been set.After the 2002 World Championships I was a man on a mission. The time
had come to take my game to a new level. I had felt up close and personal
what the best in the world was all about and I knew it was within reach. This
next phase of my learning process would be about building and reﬁning a
competitive repertoire that was uniquely my own. Immediately after coming
home to New York City, my work began.
The ﬁrst couple months of training after the Worlds were mostly mental.
For one thing, I had to let my body heal. My shoulder was a mess and it
needed some time before it could take full-tilt impact. So I studied tapes,
broke down the technical repertoires of Chen Ze-Cheng and the other top
Taiwanese players. Watching hours of footage frame by frame I picked up on
inﬁnitely subtle setups and plays with footwork that really opened my eyes to
what I was up against. The difference between numbers 3 and 1 is
mountainous. I would have to become a whole other kind of athlete. Step by
step.
By mid January I was back on the mats doing soft training that didn’t
aggravate the injury but kept my body ﬂuid. I worked on some new technical
ideas, integrated the movements into my arsenal by doing slow-motion
repetitions. By March I could mix it up at full speed without worrying about
my shoulder, but I still wasn’t playing competitively so much as working on
the ideas I described in the chapters Making Smaller Circles, Slowing Down
Time, and The Illusion of the Mystical. I was still in the “research and
development” stage.
I have talked about style, personal taste, being true to your natural
disposition. This theme is critical at all stages of the learning process. If you
think about the high-end learning principles that I have discussed in this
book, they all spring out of the deep, creative plunge  into an initially small
pool of information. In the early chapters, I described the importance of a
chess player laying a solid foundation by studying positions of reduced
complexity (endgame before opening). Then we apply the internalized principles
to increasingly complex scenarios. In Making Smaller Circles we take a single
technique or idea and practice it until we feel its essence. Then we gradually
condense the movements while maintaining their power, until we are left
with an extremely potent and nearly invisible arsenal. In Slowing Down Time,
we again focus on a select group of techniques and internalize them until the
mind perceives them in tremendous detail. After training in this manner, wecan see more frames in an equal amount of time, so things feel slowed down.
In The Illusion of the Mystical, we use our cultivation of the last two principles
to control the intention of the opponent—and again, we do this by zooming
in on very small details to which others are completely oblivious.
The beautiful thing about this approach to learning is that once we have
felt the profound reﬁnement of a skill, no matter how small it may be, we can
then use that feeling as a beacon of quality as we expand our focus onto more
and more material. Once you know what good feels like, you can zero in on it,
search it out regardless of the pursuit. On a large scale, this is how I
translated my unde rstanding of chess to the martial arts. On a smaller, more
focused scale, this is how I trained for the 2004 W orld Championships.
While this principle of penetrating the macro through the micro is a
critical idea in the developmental process, it is also an absolutely pivotal
founda tion for a great competitor. At the highest levels of any kind of
competitive discipline, everyone is great. At this point the decisive factor is
rarely who knows more, but who dictates the tone of the battle. For this
reason, almost without exception, champions are specialists whose styles
emerge from profound awareness of their unique strengths, and who are
exceedingly skilled at guiding the battle in that direction.
With this in mind, m y training for the 2004 W orld Championships would
have to be built around my core strengths. Sure, I am a good athlete, but
frankly there would be many ﬁghters in Taiwan who were more gifted than
me physically. Some would be stronger, some would be faster, some would
have more endurance. But there would be no other ﬁghter who could keep up
with me strategically. To win in the Chung Hwa Cup, I would have to bring
water to their ﬁre. I wouldn’t be successful making the ﬁghts a test of speed
and acrobatics. I would have to read opponents and shut them down, confront
them with strategies and reﬁnements they couldn’t imagine. To have any
chance in the ring with him, I would have to dictate the tone of battle and
make Chen Ze-Cheng pl ay chess with me.
I had one good thing go ing for me. As I described in the end of Part II, my
main training partner in my preparations for the tournament was my friend
Dan Caulﬁeld. Dan is an incredible natural athlete and a lifetime martial
artist. Since childhood, a huge  part of Dan’s life has been devoted to exploring
the outer reaches of his physical potential. As a boy growing up in rural New
Hampshire, he taught himself to jump from higher and higher surfaces untilhe could comfortably leap off a thirty-foot roof, land in a roll, and come up
running. If you point to a car, if he is in the mood, Dan will jump over it. If
you look at a steep cliff or a brick wall, Dan can ﬁgure out how to climb it. If
you go hiking with Dan, he leaps from boulder to boulder up the mountain
like a goat. Add in over ﬁfteen years of Aikido and Tai Chi Chuan training,
and you’ve got yourself a force to be reckoned with.
The lucky thing for me was that Dan is built somewhat like Chen Ze-
Cheng, he shares Chen’s enormous physical talent, and stylistically they are
both predators. While both are technically masterful, they also have the
tendency to take big risks, believing in their athleticism to help them recover
if put into a bad position. This is what I had to build on. To win in Taiwan, I
would have to use Chen’s greatness against him.
In the two years before the 2004  Taiwan tournament, Dan and I basically
lived on the mats together. Some nights we were drilling techniques,
building the power of our throws while the other was just a body, hitting the
ground a hundr ed times before switching roles. In other sessions we were
reﬁning footwork, breaking down the precise components of going with
momentum when someone has an edge and tries to spin you to the ﬂoor or
out of the ring. It’s amazing how you can land on your feet and balanced if
you know how to stay calm and principled, embrace the chaos, while you are
spun with a torque that sends sweat hitting walls ten feet away. But more
often than not Dan and I were duking it out. Night after night we had brutal
sessions, spending hours in the ring, squaring off, clashing, neutralizing
attacks, exploding onto weaknesses, hitting the ground, getting back up, and
colliding again like rams.
Dan and I continuously pushed each other to improve. We were both
working so hard that if one of us stopped learning, he would get killed in the
ring. It was during the last four months of our preparation that I came upon
my funda mental strategy for the tournament—what chess players call
prophylaxis. You see, I believe that Dan, like Chen Ze-Cheng, is a more gifted
athlete than me. For all my training, he can do things that boggle my mind.
So when working with Dan I developed a game that was based on squelching
his talents. In Taiwan I would play in the style of Karpov or Petrosian, the
Grandmasters who triggered my existential crisis at the end of my chess
career.In the last months of Taiwan training, instead of trying to blow Dan out of
the ring, I tried to shut him down, crimp his game, and use the tiniest
overextensions to my advantage. I created an approach we called the
Anaconda. I would pressure my opponent, stiﬂe his attacks, slowly inch him
out of the ring while cutting off escape paths. If my opponent breathed, I
would take space when he exhaled. This was a game that relied on keen
presence and sensitivity to my opponent’s intention. Every aggressive move in
a martial arts confrontation is risky. To attempt a throw, you weaken your
structure if only for a ﬂash. I would use that ﬂash. Whe never Dan tried to
throw me, I entered the attack, took space, and tried to simultaneously
neutralize his aggression and cinch down the pressure.
Week after week, I got better at this. I was creating the anti-Chen Ze-
Cheng game. And Dan got better at attacking me. Some nights I would
dominate him, repress his every attack, and then explode in my own throws
when he got desperate. Other nights he would be electric and destroy me. I
remember one night in particular when he felt like a jaguar. He was all over
me, above me, behind me, on ﬁre with an animal inspiration. I limped home
feeling absolutely bereft, but the next night I came in and locked him down.
For the ﬁnal three months before Taiwan, I recorded all of Dan’s and my
training sessions. Then, every night I would go home and study the tapes.
This was valuable on a number of munda ne levels. Watching yourself on
video, you can spot tells or bad habits. You can reﬁne your techniques by
breaking down what works and what doesn’t. But the primary function the
tapes had for me was very different.
Dan and I had both reached such a high level of presence to incoming
aggression that our sessions were marked by fewer and fewer points. We knew
each other’s games, we knew what attacks were coming, we knew how to
probe without overextending. Dan had ﬁgured out how to play against my
right shoulder in a manner that neutralized most of my aggressive impulses,
and I could usually take advantage of his attacks to edge him out of the ring.
If you took our physical and mental abilities, put them together, and collided
them on the mats, we were dead even. We were also performing at peak
levels, so few mistakes were being made. We were in a state of dynamic
equilibrium. The only times points were scored were in moments of creative
inspiration, when one of us did something that transcended our current level
of ability. These were the moments I focused on in the videos.Two or three times in an evening, Dan and I would be in the middle of a
wild ﬂurry and sudde nly my body would put his body on the ground. Just
like that. And two or three times, he would do the same to me. We were
playing w ith such a tight margin, that I couldn’t think about a technique and
then do it to him. No way it would catch him off-guard. But a few times my
instincts would ﬁnd s omething that my conscious mind di dn’t pick up o n.
Whe n I went home and watched the video, I studied each of these
moments frame by frame to see what happened. Sometimes I would see
myself triggering into a throw just as Dan’s blink began. Other times, my
body would direct a throw off to a creative new angle that caught Dan
unawares. Maybe my footwork would fall into rhythm with his in a manner
that opened up a tiny gap of momentum to ride, or I might catch him at the
beginning of an exhalation. There were many moments like this, each of
which I studied until I unde rstood. The next day I would come into training
and tell Dan what I discovered. We would then convert what had been
creative inspiration into something we unde rstood technically. If my body
synched up with his breathing, we broke down how to do this at will. If I
caught a blink, we studied the nuances of blinking. Next time we sparred,
Dan would be aware of the new weapon I was working with, and so he would
create a counter in order to stay in the game. Then I would work against his
counter. This way we raised the baseline of our everyday level, and
incrementally expanded the horizon of what our creative bursts could attain.
Let’s think about this method in the langua ge of chess: If a chess expert
were to have his most inspired day he would come up with ideas that would
blow his mind and the minds of others at his level. But for the master, these
inspired creations would be humdrum. They are the everyday because his
knowledge of chess allows him to play this way all the time. While the
weaker player might say, “I just had a feeling,” the stronger player would
shrug and explain the principles behind the inspired move. This is why
Grandmasters can play speed chess games that weaker masters wouldn’t
unde rstand in hundr eds of hours of study: they have internalized such esoteric
patterns and principles that breathtakingly precise decisions are made
intuitively. The technical afterthoughts of a truly great one can appear to be
divine inspiration to the lesser artist.
Whe n I think about creativity, it is always in relation to a founda tion. We
have our knowledge. It becomes deeply internalized until we can access itwithout thinking about it. Then we have a leap that uses what we know to go
one or two steps further. We make a discovery. Most people stop here and
hope that they will become inspired and reach that state of “divine insight”
again. In my mind, this is a missed opportunity. Imagine that you are
building a pyramid of knowledge. Every level is constructed of technical
information and principles that explain that information and condense it into
chunks  (as I explained in the chapter Slowing Down Time). Once you have
internalized enough information to complete one level of the pyramid, you
move on to the next. Say you are ten or twelve levels in. Then you have a
creative burst like the ones Dan and I had in the ring. In that moment, it is
as if you are seeing something that is suspended in the sky just above the top
of your pyramid. There is a connection between that discovery and what you
know—or else you wouldn’t have discovered it—and you can ﬁnd that
connection if you try. The next step is to ﬁgure out the technical components
of your creation. Figure out what makes the “magic” tick.
The way this process functioned with Dan and m e was that my body would
somehow put him on the ground. The way I did it was outside both our
conceptual schemes, so neither of us really knew what happened. Then I went
home and studied the tape. I saw, for example, that my throw triggered from
a precise grappling position at the exact moment that Dan’s left foot received
his weight from his right foot. I didn’t do this consciously—my body just did
it instinctively. But now we have learned that in that particular position, an
opponent is vulnerable when he shifts his weight in that manner. The next
step for me is to create techniques that force the switch of weight. And Dan
can become more conscious to avoid the trap. We both get better and better
at playing around the split second when the weight settles on the ground
through the left foot. We have created a body of theory around a ﬂeeting
moment of inspiration. Now there are techniques and principles that make
this weapon accessible all the time. We have taken our pyramid of knowledge
up one level and solidiﬁed a higher founda tion for new leaps.
After seven or eight weeks of this work, we had internalized a very tight
network of martial arts techniques that were all the products of Dan’s and my
most inspired moments. This became our championship arsenal. Wha t we
constructed was all new, highly personalized, and completely true to our
individual strengths. And most of it was psychological. It was about getting
in the opponent’s head, catching his rhythms, controlling his intention withsubtle technical manipulation. Whe n we went to Taiwan, we were ready for
war.
I. As a reminder, by “root” I am referring to the ability to hold one’s ground while directing incoming
force down, into the ﬂoor. You can then channel the force back up from the ground and bounce an
opponent away. When a martial artist is described as having a “deep root” the parallel is to a tree—it
feels as if his or her body is extended into the earth.CHAPTER 20
TAIWAN
2004 Chung Hwa Cup Tai Chi Chuan World Championships Taipei, December 2–5, 2004
Clouds moved fast, dark and grey, the rain coming in gusts and then tapering
off as Typhoon Nanmadol surged over the South China Sea. I’ve always loved
storms; now these ﬁerce winds made me electric. It was Thursday evening,
forty hours from battle, and I stood at the peak of Elephant Mountain looking
down on an Old Taoist Temple, the city of Taipei spread out below. The smell
of incense wafted up from the temple shrine, smoke swirling in the building
winds. I’d begun preparing for this tournament, the World Championships,
the day after losing in the semiﬁnals two years before. My last three months
of training had been brutal. Night after night of pain, pushing myself to the
absolute limit until nothing was left, and then dragging myself home to rest
up for the next day’s sessions. Now I stood, breathing deeply, soaking in the
wind and rain. The sky to the west was a livid red—it was coming. I felt alive
and ready.
*  *  *
There are two kinds of Push Hands in the Chung Hwa Cup. One is called
Fixed Step. The other is Moving Step. Together they make up two divisions
in this gigantic international competition that draws thousands of martial
artists from more than ﬁfty nations. The events are very different and most
competitors specialize in either one or the other. It was my dream—in truth,
it was my ambition—to win both.
The Moving Step game is fast, explosive, played in an eighteen-foot-
diameter ring. The object is either to put your opponent on the ground or outof the ring. The inner game of Moving Step is subtle; it requires ﬁne-tuned
presence, technical mastery, and quickly evolving strategy. But from the
outside much more apparent is the feral athleticism of the best ﬁghters. It is
a physical and m ental melee of the highest order.
The Taiwan-style Fixed Step game is much more restrictive—in many
ways, it is the truest test of a Tai Chi practitioner because there is no way to
get around the internal principles of the art. There is no room to mask
technical weakness with athleticism in Fixed Step. It is minimal, like haiku.
You have two highly trained martial artists engaging in an explosive contest
at very close range. There is great potential for injury because of violent
clashing and sudde n joint manipulation. The game is tight and the power
generated is so condensed that an untrained spectator can often see nothing
until one ﬁghter sudde nly goes ﬂying away from the other and lands on his
back eight or ten feet away.
Thursday night, about four hours after I got back from my blustery hike
up Elephant Mountain, I found out that the tournament ofﬁcials had changed
the rules of the competition. Previous years in Taiwan, Fixed Step had been
played on raised pedestals, each ﬁghter standing with his right foot forward,
left foot back about three feet to allow for a dynamic, rooted stance. In this
year’s competition, the Taiwanese removed the pedestals without any warning
to foreign teams. This apparently small alteration in format would give a
crucial advantage to the local teams who had been training unde r the correct
conditions for the previous year. I will come back to this surprise soon—but
ﬁrst imagine a Fixed Step competition.
The forward feet of the opponents are lined up heel to toe, about one foot
apart. Players are very close together, with opposing right wrists crossed and
touching, and left hands hanging by the left hips like old Western
gunﬁght ers. In this posture the mental game begins. Players stand still,
poised, vying for subtle advantages that will key explosive attacks. This
moment is an energetic stare-down.
Then the ref says go and play erupts. The ﬁrst to move a foot loses the
point, or if someone is thrown to the ground, two points. If a lead ever
exceeds ten points in a round, round over. At ﬁrst glance, it looks like power
and speed are decisive. Who ever is faster getting his hands on the other guy
seems to win. But if you break the game down it becomes apparent that
certain techniques refute other techniques. Every attack will get you thrownon the ﬂoor if met by the right counter, but moves and combinations of
moves come so fast it feels like a guessing ga me—martial rock/paper/scissors.
This is only the beginning. There is a sea of potential that ﬂows from this
opening stance, an almost inﬁnite number of feints, swift attacks from all
angles, psychological ploys. In time, with years of creative training and a
willingne ss to invest in loss, to take blow after blow and get blasted off the
pedestals as a way of life, the game starts to slow down. You see attacks
coming in slow motion and play refutational maneuvers in the blink of an
eye. Great players are doing many invisible things in this game. It feels like
chess. At the highest level of the sport, you are living inside your opponent’s
head and di recting w hat he comes at you with.
Because each Fixed Step point begins exactly the same way, with two
players assuming an identical opening posture, competitors can plan attacks
in advance and over time build repertoires of combinations and defenses that
they ﬁre into when the ref sets play in motion—in the same manner that
strong chess players have sophisticated opening repertoires. Since the ﬁrst
time I went to Taiwan four years earlier, I had been breaking down the game
and creating Fi xed Step theory that emerges from the agreed opening po sture:
standing on pedestals with the set hand positions. Taiwanese ofﬁcials had sent
us the exact dimensions of the pedestals months before this tournament. I
had then internalized my arsenal of attacks and neutralizations, and was so
comfortable with the game that I often trained with my eyes closed, allowing
opponents to trigger ﬁrst. My body would shrug off the attacks and explode
into instinctual counters. All of this training was done while rooting on two
small pedestals.
Now, one day before the competition begins, the news was that there were
no pedestals and the rear hand would begin on the opponent’s elbow instead
of by the hip. This is a huge  structural change. The equivalent in chess would
be for a Grandmaster to spend ﬁve months preparing an opening repertoire
for a World Championship match and then, before game one, to discover that
the whole repertoire had been disallowed by a mysterious rule change.
In a minute everything had shifted, and we had a handful of hours to re-
create an entire repertoire. On one level this was infuriating; on another it
was predictable. Tai Chi is an emblem of Chinese and Taiwanese greatness. In
a way, this discipline represents their sporting and philosophical essence. The
top Taiwanese competitors train since childhood, many hours a day. If theywin this tournament, they are national heroes. They take home a substantial
cash prize and also get full scholarships to university. A career can be made in
a day. Foreigners are welcome, but no one wants them to win. The Taiwanese
pull out the stops to prevent it. It is a question of national pride.
At 1 A.M. Thursday night Max Chen and I were up exploring the nuances
of this new structure. Max is my teacher’s son and a very close friend of mine.
He has been the U.S. National San Shou (Chinese kickboxing) Champion
three times, and is an accomplished Push Hands player. Max knows what it’s
like to be on the front lines in international competition. We made a plan.
Then I lay in bed visualizing unt il 3 A.M.
By Friday morning it was pouring torrentially. Typhoon Nanmadol was
just offshore. I’ve been through a number of hurricanes on boats in the
Bahamas, and something about this type of brooding, ominous buildup in the
sky clicks me into a highly efﬁcient place. I was on ﬁre with ideas. We had
intended to rest Friday, ﬁll up the tanks, but that wasn’t an option anymore
with the new rules. The whole team, ten of us, gathered unde r a huge  gazebo-
type structure in the park by Hsinchuang Stadium, where the tournament
would be held. After living and dying on the mats together for the past year,
we were a family, a dedicated unit, with utter conviction about our work, and
yet from one angle our situation was surely preposterous. We were gathered
outside in a typhoon trying to ﬁgure out how to survive without pedestals.
Max had spent the morning jogging through the downpour trying to sweat
off four pounds before the weigh-in. The wind was howling and even unde r
the gazebo, rain hit us horizontally.
Dan and I worked together reﬁning new strategies on the ﬂy. While our
teammates did some light sparring, we spent two hours re-creating our Fixed
Step theory. The key was to roll with the evolving situation and contour new
tactics around the principles we had discovered back home. When hit with
such surprises, if you have a solid founda tion, you should be ﬁne. Tactics
come easy once principles are in the blood. I felt conﬁde nt. House rules are
almost always in effect when playing on the road—I knew this from the chess
days and previous Taiwanese debacles. Handling dirty tricks is a part of the
game.
DAY 1Saturday morning. We arrived at the stadium and weighed in at 7:30 A.M.,
everybody hung ry, but no eating until we made weight. After all the
preparation, there is nothing like that feeling of icy reality that hits when the
opening be ll is near.
At the weigh station reality sunk in one step deeper when we saw Chen
Ze-Cheng and his team—the dominant school in the world. He was the guy
who had beaten me two years earlier and whom I had been preparing for all
this time. I walked over and said hello, and Chen told me that he was
competing unde r 75 kilos (165.3 pounds), the weight division below me. I
was shocked. I had spent two years dreaming about this great ﬁghter,
strategizing against his sinuous cat-quick game; in my mind, winning the
world championship had meant defeating Chen Ze-Cheng. But then he
pointed toward their guy in my division and I took a deep breath. They called
him Buffalo and he looked like pure power. In Taiwan he was considered
unbe atable. He’d been groomed to become a world champion since he was a
young boy. He was a little shorter than me and much thicker. He weighed in
at 79.96  kilos (176.3 pounds). I weighed in at 78.16. He was four pounds
heavier than me and probably cut ﬁfteen pounds to make weight. The guy
was a daunting phy sical specimen.
After the weigh-in, my team and I went and checked out the Moving Step
ring. I felt the traction of the mats, then moved around a little. Immediately
alarm bells were going off—the ring seemed too small. Tournament ofﬁcials
had sent us rules and ring dimensions months ago: a six-meter-diameter
circle. We used their precise dimensions to set up our training mats for both
Fixed and Moving. I had internalized the dimensions of the circle and knew
exactly how it felt when my heel was a quarter inch from the edge. If you step
over the border in Moving Step you lose a point, and in the ﬂurries of action
there is no time to look down—ring sense is huge ly important. We measured
and the diameter was ﬁfteen inches smaller than what they had sent us. This
was the second dirty trick and the matches hadn’t even begun. So we had to
adjust. Typical, but there was nothing to be gained by getting worked up
about it.
We walked to the hotel in the rain, ate a big meal, and came back at 10
A.M. fueled for battle. The Fixed and Moving competitions would be going on
at the same time. Two rings would be used for Moving Step, three for Fixed.
Weight divisions were every ﬁve kilos, with men and women competingseparately. Over four thousand competitors from all over the world were
milling around, and the stadium was mobbed with fans, many of them
chanting eupho nically in languages I didn’t unde rstand. It was a great,
lilting, hypnotic sound. Acres away, on the far side of the arena, balletic Tai
Chi form competition was taking place. Blood and meditation were
coexisting.
My ﬁrst match would be Moving Step. The rules, simply put, are as
follows: Play begins from contact—this is a grappling competition like
wrestling or judo, so striking is suppo sedly not encouraged. The target area is
from the waist to just below the neck. You cannot lock your hands behind
someone’s back or grab their clothes, otherwise play is wide open. You gain
one point for throwing the guy out of the ring, two points for a clean throw
where the opponent hits the ﬂoor and you are standing. One point for a throw
where you go down on top of the opponent. Matches are three rounds, two
minutes playing time each. If someone leads by four points in a round, it is
over. Two out of three rounds wins and if rounds and points are even by the
end of three rounds, the lighter guy wins. That rarely happens, but if the
Buffalo and I stayed healthy and managed to make it into the last round, it
could give me a tiny edge.
My ﬁrst Moving Step opponent was strong, fast, and aggressive. His speed
surprised me—a very good athlete. All the players from the top Taiwanese
schools have a way of putting the cardio load on the opponent and draining
him with subtle pressure and leverage. They have excellent pummeling
techniques, which means they know how to take inside position with their
forward arm in the clinch. Imagine an opponent’s left foot forward, left arm
deep unde r my armpit and wrapped around my back or up my shoulder. That
is an unde rhook. Pummeling is the ﬁght for that position. The inside arm
tends to give more leverage and slightly better angles for throws. If a player
has “double inside position” it means that he has unde rhooks on both sides.
This is considered to be very advantageous in all grappling arts. If you ever
hear martial artists talking about a “pummeling war” they don’t mean that
two people are clobbering one another, but that they are ﬁghting for
unde rhooks.
It turns out that pummeling would be a huge  component of my
tournament strategy. You may recall that I hurt my right shoulder ﬁghting
Chen Ze-Cheng in the semiﬁnals of the 2002 World Championships. Sincethen, the shoulder has been my Achilles heel. About three months before this
year’s Taiwan tournament, the 2004 Worlds, Dan came upon an interesting
method in training. Whe never I had the right side unde rhook in the clinch,
he would clamp down on my elbow from the outside in a manner that just
killed my shoulder. After weeks of pain, I decided to concede the pummeling
war and take double outside position in training to avoid damaging the
shoulder any further. While I initially felt at a disadvantage giving Dan the
unde rhooks, over time I became increasingly comfortable. I came up with
some subtle ways to crimp his leverage and I found that I could make the
angles work for me.
In my ﬁnal ten weeks of preparation, when training with anyone other
than Dan, I felt completely dominant from the outside position. My weakness
had blossomed into a weapon that would prove critical for me in Taiwan. You
see, the Taiwanese are lightning-quick with their pummeling and I made the
decision early in the tournament not to ﬁght it—do n’t play their game. By
giving them that ﬁrst position they were so used to ﬁghting for, I mitigated a
large part of their training: the pummeling war. Then we would do battle in
the setup I had become expert in, and that they hadn’t studied as deeply. This
happens all the time in chess at the highest levels; top players discover
hidden resources in opening positions that had been considered theoretically
weak. They become masters of a forgotten or undiscovered battleground and
then gui de opponents into the briar patch.
So my ﬁrst opponent was very aggressive but nothing he brought felt
dangerous. His pummeling was excellent and he came at me with
tremendous conﬁdence, but once I locked down on him from the outside his
structure felt a little unsound, like a grand house with a ﬂawed founda tion. I
knew that if I weathered his early attacks, I’d be ﬁne. I crimped his attempts
to use the unde rhooks and edged him out of the ring a couple of times. I went
up two points in round o ne and just held the lead.
Then I watched the Buffalo. Wow! First he blew the other ﬁghter out of
the ring. Then, lightning-quick, he trapped both of the opponent’s arms
unde r his left armpit, took the guy’s back, and ﬂipped him over a deep leg.
He manhandled the guy, and looked unbe atable. At one point after a throw it
looked as if he would fall but he somehow did a full split, caught himself,
with heel and toe, and just popped back up, getting the full two points. This
was my man. I had to ﬁnd a  weakness but didn’t see it.My next match was Fixed Step. Not much problem, except for the judge s.
Many points that I won, the scorekeeper didn’t record. This was infuriating
but also hilarious. Imagine, the referee would signal that I’d won the point
but the scorekeeper would neglect to write it down as if he’d forgotten or
hadn’t noticed. This happened again and again. My teammates and father
were screaming about it, but nothing was done except that ofﬁcials would
nod to them with placid smiles. It happened to every foreigner in the
tournament, sometimes decisively. This was the way they kept score here.
Their country. Nothing to do but score more points and keep the static out of
my head. Against most guys the judge s couldn’t really hurt me. But in the
ﬁnal rounds where we were evenly matched, there would be little margin for
error. I tried not to think about it.
Whe never I had a break I watched the Buffalo. He won his points easily.
He had ﬁne technique but he was also much more powerful than his
opponents. He could blast most guys right out of the ring in a ﬂurry of
explosive aggression. But I started to sense some small vulnerability. Maybe.
He was technically sharp with dazzling footwork, speed, and a deeply rooted
stance, but something about his structure teased me.
In my next Fixed Step match I faced off with the top guy from the school
from Tainan that is the main rival to Chen Ze-Cheng’s team. They are ﬁerce
competitors, like soldiers, strong, fast, well trained, pure aggression. All
signs pointed to a war, but we touched hands and I knew I had him. You can
read a lot about a martial artist from the opening contact. Great ones feel
mountainous, like the earth is moving inside of them. Others ring more
hollow. He bounced right off me on the ﬁrst couple of points. Then I started
mixing things up and he couldn’t keep up with the tactics I threw at him. I
won the ﬁrst two rounds by a big margin, no injuries. Match over. I watched
the Buffalo compete again in Fixed and he was overwhelming against a lesser
opponent, but I had this building feeling that there was something a little
wrong with his founda tion. He was so physically gifted that it was easy to
stand gaping as he tossed the guy to the ﬂoor left and right, but he seemed to
be covering something up with all the ﬂash. I wasn’t sure why or how, but in
Fixed he felt mortal. In Moving Step, he  seemed uns toppable.
Day one was over and I wasn’t injured. This is a long tournament, a
marathon of sprints. Almost all of these martial arts competitions last only
one day because players’ bodies usually break down after that. You can pushthrough v irtually anything in eight or ten hours, but then the injuries burrow
in overnight and you can’t walk or lift your arms in the morning. This
tournament is two days. You have to win on Saturday without getting badly
hurt to have a chance to become World Champion on Sunda y.
I went to bed listening to the rain outside my window, and I dreamed
about the Buffalo.
DAY 2
Sunda y morning, 8 A.M. We arrived at the stadium in time for an unha ppy
surprise. The Taiwanese ofﬁcials had created a separate tournament for
foreigners and scheduled to run it before the championship rounds. I was
informed that participation was mandatory. I asked whether this could take
place after the main event and was told that it was impossible. This absurd
tournament within the tournament clearly had the function of exhausting and
injuring foreigners who were still competing for medals against the
Taiwanese in the Championship. A time-consuming protest ensued with a
tremendous langua ge barrier eventually being bridged by my teacher, who
fortunately had some weight. It was agreed, ﬁnally, that those of us who were
still in the main competition could take part after our ﬁnal matches.
I had two ﬁghts left in each division to win. First was Moving semiﬁnals,
against the number one ﬁghter from the tough Tainan school. Moving was his
specialty and he came right at me, elbows tight in the pummeling, fast,
persistent, putting the cardio load on me. He attacked early and I circled out
but stepped on the line. My instincts were off—I thought I was well in
bounds, but was wrong. On our mats at home I would have been in. Bad
move. Down 1–0. We went back at it. I let him push me to the edge of the
ring, baiting him, and exploded into a reversal that put him inches from the
line, but he had a deep root and wouldn’t go out. Then I switched gears and
went on the offensive, pressuring him, using the Anaconda technique I had
developed three months earlier—inching him out, surging, tightening the
noose whenever he tried to squirm away, clamping down when he exhaled. In
the ﬁnal seconds I caught him with a beautiful throw but my shoulder got
jammed on the landing.
I was on my back between rounds, breathing hard. This may have had a
telling psychological effect. In preparation the last few months, we did a lotof interval training, building sprint time in the ring and working on
recovery. We would play one-minute rounds with one-minute breaks
between, sometimes going ﬁfteen or twenty rounds like that, four of us
playing, alternating play and recovery. My idea was to be able to have a wild
sprint, drain myself completely, and know I could come back in the next
round e ven if I felt like death baked over.
Interestingly, months before the competition the organizers told us that
there would be thirty seconds between rounds and w e found o ut upon arriving
in Taiwan that it was one minute. So I had been doing this one-minute
interval work with the team largely as a training mechanism to work on
going all-out without overextending, and also to condense recovery time.
Now we showed up and there were one-minute breaks between rounds. Their
switch played right into our hands. I knew I could spend every last drop if I
had to, and then I would be back and okay sixty seconds later if I lay on my
back breathing de eply. I looked like a dead man between rounds, but was ﬁne.
Round two. He shot right in at the bell. I held him off, gave him the
unde rhooks, locked down, cranked, right, left, he went with it, but then I
caught him on the third try, spun him out of the ring and onto the ﬂoor.
These guys are great technicians and I really ﬁgured out how to shut them
down. By just giving them that ﬁrst position they were so used to ﬁghting
for, I created a new battleﬁeld. There was no resistance where they expected it
and then much more where they were less prepared. Amazing how it all
started with an old shoulder injury.
I was in his head and up 2–0. He looked confused. Then the confusion
turned to desperation and he charged me, putting everything he had into one
last attack, torquing wildly, out of control. I went with the force, landed on
my feet, and used the momentum to toss him out of the ring and onto the
ﬂoor. Round a nd m atch were mine.
I watched the Buffalo annihilate another opponent. Just him and me in
Moving Step for the title. I still didn’t see a weakness in his game, but I had a
plan. There were forty-ﬁve minutes before my Fixed Step semis and I had a
rough time. My shoulder hurt so badly, I couldn’t lift my right arm up past
my waist. I was all banged up, black eye, forehead one big rug burn, pain all
through me. The shoulder had me concerned. Dan and I were the only guys
on our team left in the main draw and we sprawled on the mats while
teammates massaged our legs, shoulders, arms. I put on my hood, sat in acorner, and hoped my body could hold out for three more matches; then it
didn’t matter.
They called me up for Fixed Step semis and it took a lot to walk over to
the ring. My opponent was somebody I had been watching througho ut the
tournament—in his forties, barrel-chested, serene, and powerful, the man had
the feeling of a samurai. He was older than almost all the competitors, the
only guy his age still in the competition. I had watched him dispense with
younge r, athletic opponents left and right, and he clearly had amazing skill.
Wha t I didn’t know is that he was one of the most respected teachers in the
world. The stadium was loaded with his students. I heard chanting and knew
it wasn’t for me.
Round one. Our wrists connected and before the ﬁrst point began he was
working on me, taking space in that strange internal way some of these rare
ones can. The ref said “Go!” I attacked fast, met empty space, and ﬂew into it.
Down 1–0. This guy had the stuff, the magic if there were magic in the
martial arts. Next point I bounced off him. Powerful root. I couldn’t attack
him. I tried a lateral technique and won a point. He blasted me once and then
pulled me into a black hole. I was down 4–1. I tend to feel pretty invincible
in Fixed Step, but this man understood things about Tai Chi I had not yet
discovered.
The rounds in Fixed Step are thirty seconds stop time (the clock is stopped
after each point). This is enough time for 15–20 fast exchanges. Not much
time to ﬁgure things out. I sank deep on an attack and actually moved him
backward. My point, but a referee came over and said that the point didn’t
count because my opponent’s initial structure was illegal. Strange logic. Then
I scored another point that they waved off. I heard my team and pop going
crazy.
I had been to this tournament twice before and both times was shocked by
the mendacity of the judge s. This time the pattern was familiar to me.
Basically, this is how it works: There is grand ceremony welcoming the
foreigners, but they don’t want us to win. The way they tend to steer results is
by making some horriﬁc calls early in the match to get the momentum going
in the direction of the local player. Usually when a foreign competitor starts
to feel that the match is rigged he gets increasingly desperate and over-
aggressive. Instead of competing with presence he becomes overwrought and
caught up in a downward spiral. His game falls apart. Then, once theTaiwanese player is in control of the match, the judging becomes exceedingly
fair. In fact, they become overly kind to create the illusion of fairness.
I knew all of this coming in. The key was to keep on winning points, and
to immediately come back from a bad call with a huge  surge. Don’t get
rattled! If I controlled the momentum of the game, it would be hard for
judge s to take matches away. That was the plan. To be honest, I also felt a lot
of love for my opponent in this match. The whole stadium was against me,
except for our U.S. contingent of ten. I didn’t blame the Taiwanese for
wanting their man to win.
I was down three points, and needed to come back. He won another one. I
had to stop the slide now, right now, or I wouldn’t be able to catch up. I’d
created a move two months earlier that I thought might be decisive in the
tournament. We called it the bear hug. I would allow my opponent to come
straight in on my chest with a hard attack. My two arms circled fast behind
him and on the push I sank deep while pulling him down with me. I could
also crank left or right with it. When applied cleanly, it is disturbing to have
this done to you because it feels like you’re falling into a void and at the same
time your wrist is exploding—n o choice but to go down. I let him in, bear
hug, put  him on the ﬂoor—two points.
He was up 5–3 but hadn’t ever seen the bear hug before. I used it again,
and spun him right. Down 5–4. Now the judge  came over and tried to mess
with my head. He told me to adjust my left-hand position on the starting
posture—just psychological manipulation. I smiled at the ref and kept
ﬁghting. Bear hug again, it’s even. Now my opponent stepped off the mats
and came back with a different feeling. He was beginning to understand. He
changed his left arm to trap my right if I bear-hugge d. He had answers and I
had new variations. We were ﬂowing now, moves coming fast like speed chess
in Washington Square Park.
This Fixed Step game is a sublime experience. At ﬁrst it feels fast and
jolty, like a painful guessing game, but then the play slows down in your
mind. Over the years, as I became more and more relaxed unde r this kind of
ﬁre, and as my body built up enough resistance that the blows didn’t bother
me, the game became completely mental. It almost always felt as though I
was seeing or feeling the action in more frames than my opponents, and so I
could zoom in on the tiniest details, like the blink of an eye or the beginning
of an exhalation. Whe n our wrists connected, I usually felt exactly what myopponent would come at me with, and I learned how to apply the subtlest of
pressures in order to dictate his intention. But this great Fixed Step ﬁghter
imposed his own reality. I couldn’t get in his head. Or every time I got in he
kicked me back out.
I tried the bear hug again but he jammed it. He’d ﬁgured it out. My own
teammates hadn’t learned how to parry the bear hug in two months of work.
This guy took seconds. I was down 7–5, without much time left in the round.
I faked a hard attack, but then slipped in a right unde rhook and threw him
away. I was down one point with 1.1 seconds left. I needed to score fast and
surged hard with a four-strike combination that scored at the bell. Round one
was a tie, barely.
The second round is always played with the left foot forward. For some
reason my opponent’s structure didn’t feel quite as solid with the legs
reversed in the opening position. I began sinking deeply on my attacks,
playing with feints, tight combinations, and misdirection. I noticed that if I
faked in my mind, without even moving, he felt it and responded. He was
incredibly sensitive to intention, so I started unba lancing him with invisible
attacks that I pulsed into but didn’t actually manifest physically. I was
getting in his head. He felt it and got aggressive, attacked hard, and blasted
me away. But now I had him attacking, and I knew I had a deeper root. I
started receiving his blows and bouncing him off—won a bunc h of points.
Then I made the mistake of coming straight in and he threw me on the ﬂoor
—two points. If I lowered the sophistication of my game a hair, he destroyed
me. He slipped into a zone and attacked hard. We were even with three
seconds to go in the round. I uprooted him with a four-prong combination,
most of which didn’t actually happen. Then I took the next point at the bell
with a huge  surge and w on the round.
Round three, right leg forward again, this was where he liked it, but me
too. We started trading points, back and forth, a war. My team was chanting
Tiger, Tiger Buma Ye. (Bruce used to call me Tiger in the young chess days, and
it stuck.) The rest of the crowd was chanting in Mandarin. They loved him,
and I didn’t blame them. Then I noticed a hole. He had found the solution to
my bear hug, trapping my right forward elbow so I couldn’t get outside of
him—but  if I ﬂashed my mind to the bear hug, in jamming it he opened up
his armpit to inside pummeling techniques. I started taking the unde rhook
and tossing him left and right. Every point I was playing with invisible feintswhich he somehow felt, and then I exploited his reactions. Trippy idea. I was
using his crazy perceptiveness against him. Finally I caught a throw where I
got the right unde rhook and cranked him all the way over and around me. He
hit the ground hard. In that moment I felt a wave of sorrow—like I killed the
last unicorn. The match ended and we hugge d. I told him he was an
inspiration.
*  *  *
Fixed and Moving Step ﬁnals ahead, both against the Buffalo. We’d been
measuring each other for the past two days. We both knew that this
mammoth international competition would come down to our own little war.
In Moving Step, he was a force of nature. He overwhelmed his opponents
with bull rushes and highly evolved throws. His pummeling was incredible.
Dan and I had broken his game down and saw that he integrated very precise
trips and sweeps into most of his throws. I had to neutralize his footwork and
power, not get steamrolled out of the ring, counterpunc h, and look for holes.
That was the plan.
There was a one-hour break before all the ﬁnal matches. Fixed would be
ﬁrst, which was good—I’d seen a weakness in Buffalo’s structure and was
hoping to get in his head before the Moving. I was ready for war, listening to
“Lose Yourself” on the headpho nes. I felt myself steeling against the world,
like a freight train that just had its brakes cut.
FIXED STEP WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP FINALS
Buffalo walked toward the Fixed Step ring, stopped just short of me, looked
me dead in the eyes, and screamed something primal, from the gut, one note.
A chant called back from the bleachers and then the stadium exploded. This
was their man. Our wrists touched and he was all aggression. Good. I had to
use that. Keep him there. On the ﬁrst point he surged into an attack that put
me airborne. Then he came right back at me, but I let him in, circled around
his elbows with my hands and sank deep. Bear hug. He went right down, two
points. At the beginning of every exchange we stood right leg forward, the
backs of our wrists connected, waiting for the ref’s command to set play in
motion. Those seconds of standoff are psychologically complex. You can calm
an opponent or challenge his ego, make him lust for aggression. Over andover I lulled him forward with tiny little openings. He was like a bull seeing
red, charging in hard and fast, and I was always gone before he connected. I
won two points that the ref waved off. I heard people grumbling about the
ofﬁciating, but at this point I didn’t care. I was a bit of a madman, deep in
the zone. I knew that the only way to win was to win big. The bear hug was
deadly against Buffalo’s power. He kept on hitting the ﬂoor and seemed
confused. Round o ne was a blowout.
In round two I felt unstoppable. I didn’t care about the refs or the score. I
kept winning one point after the next after the next and I heard Dan and my
teammates chanting Tiger, Buma Ye, Tiger, Buma Ye. I was in his head and kept
on coming. My father said this was his favorite match, that it was a beautiful,
emotional experience to watch. To me it felt technical: I won it before
stepping in the ring. Afterward my team mobbed me and Max lifted me into
the air. The stadium was silent but for the voice of my pop and the guys
around m e. I was World Champion.
Now let’s see if I could do it twice.
MOVING STEP FINALS
Buffalo entered the ring screaming, wild, ﬁsts pumping the air. I had felt his
mortality in Fixed, which was good, but  the Moving Step would be his legacy.
He’d trained his whole life to be World Champion. I had no solutions to his
game, only ideas. He was surely the greater athlete. But maybe I was the
better thinker. The bell rang and he went right on the attack, pummeling in
for the unde rhooks. For a few seconds I fought for the inside position but he
felt too powerful and I decided to give it to him—no  reason to meet him
head-on. His left arm pummeled deep unde r my right armpit and wrapped
up my shoulder. My right foot was forward and my right arm locked down on
his left uppe r arm. He had better leverage for edging me out and for certain
throws, but I had some excellent weapons as well. Whe n the timing felt right
I cranked to the left. We went down hard together. I instigated the throw,
but my left elbow touched just before he crashed down. His point, 1–0. My
shirt was ripped up; I didn’t mind the cave man feeling, but the ofﬁcials
made me change it.
I’d lost the ﬁrst point but felt potential. Play resumed, we connected, I
disconnected, then came straight in on him and tried to jump around andtake his back but he was too quick and wrapped me up. We separated, I
danced around him, tried to enter fast and spin him but nothing there. We
felt each other out. Then he cranked hard, I went with it, spun with the force
and stayed on my feet, but when I landed he was on me, pushing hard. I
rooted it out, but he kept on coming, relentless, and he edged me out of the
ring. I’m down 2–0. About a minute to go in round one. I tried a couple of
things but couldn’t ﬁnd a hole. He was conﬁde nt, too strong; I needed to use
that strength, there was nothing else. I went into the clinch and leaned on
him, let him feel my weight and also my exhaustion. He started to edge me
out of the ring, and I let him take me there. He was cautious, tiny steps, no
overextension. My back was to the edge, I planted my left foot an inch from
the line, and exploded, drove hard against his right arm, screaming, putting
everything I had into this throw. He couldn’t hold on and I took him out of
the ring and then went down hard on top of him. It’s 2–1, eleven seconds left
in the round. I needed a point and was tapped out. Dan was screaming, my
whole team was chanting, Tiger, Tiger Buma Ye, faster and faster. I need to go
buck wild now, need one point, gotta let it all hang out. The ref said “Go!” and I
hit him like a truck, he gave a little, then held his ground, trying to hold on
for the bell. I cranked and we started spinning, my back to the edge, then his,
then mine again, total chaos. I screamed as I pulled hard and reversed him.
He was on the edge but had the unde rhooks, was okay, incredible root, and
then all I can say is that I reached deeper than I knew I had and won the most
dramatic point of my life. With one second left I drove him out of the ring,
launching through him and over him, landing him on his back, my shoulder
into his and my head over him straight into the ground. The bell rang, the
crowd went totally wild, even the Taiwanese; 2–2.
I had sixty seconds and was a dead man. I lay panting on my back for
almost all of that time. On the video, Buffalo looks physically strong but
upset. Max rubbe d my shoulders, I slowed down my breathing, thought I’d be
okay by the bell. Hoped. W asn’t so sure.
Round two. He entered the ring like an enraged beast and the bleachers
erupted in chants. I remember getting to my feet and walking slowly to the
center, hoping I could reach it without falling over. He attacked immediately
and the force went through me, into the ground. It felt like an electric
current and I bounced him off, awake now, ready to roll. No more pain. He
came at me again and cranked hard into a throw while sweeping out my rightfoot, but I felt it coming, stepped up with my left, and neutralized it while
crimping his arms. I knew I had to watch that footwork, very dangerous. We
went back into the clinch. I gave him the left unde rhook and clamped down
on the arm. He probed for a hole and I held him off, waiting, listening; the
game had grown smaller now, everything slowing down. He switched his
weight into his front leg to attack and I caught it, ﬁred into a throw in that
ﬂash that he was stuck, his foot entering the ground, no way to move, and he
went down with me right on top, my shoulder into his left side. Up 1–0. He
came right back at me, shaking off the last moment with a bull rush, but I
felt it coming and went with the force, pulled him a little farther and he hit
the ground. Up 2–0. Then I pulled off another throw, catching the same hole
in his footwork, perfect timing, inner reap, we both went up and I landed on
him hard. I’m up 3–0!
Now I made my only real mistake of the tournament. I had him totally
defeated, he came at me, and I popped him to the side, his left foot landing
inches from the edge. Then I should have backed off or gone in slow, but I
smelled the ﬁnish line and charged, overextended, and he put me down. Two
points, 3–2, he’s back in it. My mistake. Not much time left. I’m spent, so is
he. Here things really started to go out of control. He surged right at me. I
used the force and almost put him down but he barely saved himself. We ﬂew
all over the place, him attacking, me neutralizing, counterattacking, him
saving. I heard Max scream “Josh! Fifteen seconds!” I put a huge  effort into a
throw that he barely stopped. He charged, I warded it off, and I was
exhausted; it felt like the ﬁfteen seconds were over. Now, two years later, I see
on the video—Max is waving at the timekeeper, the woman is standing
holding the bell. Wha t happened here was surreal. There were many
witnesses, all with the same story. The clock hit 2:00 and the woman went to
hit the bell but an ofﬁcial motioned for her not to ring it. Clock went to 2:04,
:05, :06, we were scrambling in the ring, in total mayhem. I’d paced myself
to last ﬁfteen seconds and now I was way past blown out. I was up 3–2 and
they were holding the bell. Everyone was screaming. I was dead on my feet,
and the Buffalo put his heart, soul, blood, and guts into one more throw. I
couldn’t hold it off and started to go; he piled down on top of me, won the
point, and they rang the bell, 3–3.
Ofﬁcially the ﬁrst two rounds were tied. I was on my back, slowing down
my breathing, far beyond the most exhausted I’d ever been. Max and Danrubbe d my arms and shoulders. The bell rang. R ound t hree, it all comes down
to this. I had the tie-break if we were even. At this point it is pure guts.
Survival. You operate on another plane of reality, second to second, relying on
your training to keep you standing. The round began and I held him off, then
gave up the double unde rhooks and launched into a throw I’ve been working
on for years and hadn’t shown yet at the tournament. I trapped his right arm
unde r my left elbow, pulsed forward to provoke a reaction, and then turned
left, rolling over my right shoulder and his trapped right arm, all my weight
pulling down and away from his root. He ﬂew over me in a big circle and we
went down hard, my shoulder into his ribs. Perfectly executed, but the judge s
didn’t give it to me. I was too tired to be angry about it. They said we
touched the ﬂoor at the same time. His ribs wouldn’t agree. No score. I didn’t
have much left. We felt each other out for ten seconds, then he attacked,
forced a lean, and spun me on the mat, lovely throw. I’m down 2–0. Trouble.
Gotta dig deep. Find something.
Now he changed tactics and decided to hold me off, stalling out the
round. I searched for over a minute, spent; on the video it looks like I gave
up. My body went limp, then I saw a hole and exploded into the same throw
they just took away from me, but at the end I pushed off hard (incidentally
against my ankle, which was turned ninety degrees), arched my back, and
landed ﬂat on him so they couldn’t argue. My point, 2–1. Need one more from
somewhere.
It felt like one of those video games where the endurance of the ﬁghter is
gone and you have to hold the other guy off, survive the barrage, until you’ve
recovered enough to give him one more shot. That’s what I had to do, hold
him off until I had a little bit in me, and then put every ounce of it into a
throw that had to be perfectly timed because if it didn’t work I might just
collapse.
Then I found a little opening. I got into the clinch, trapped his right arm,
faked forward, and drove my whole being into a bicep throw. He went down,
I landed on him, shoulder to ribs. The tying point. There were nineteen
seconds left. All I have to do is hold him off and I win. Except at this moment
everything turned very, very strange. Once again, the judge s decided not to
allow my throw. They claimed it was illegal. Now people rushed onto the
ﬂoor, Americans and Taiwanese ofﬁcials. Our team had cameras shooting the
match and soon a gaggle of ofﬁcials and players from both teams werelooking into video cameras. The stadium went berserk with anger and
confusion. The judge s convened, the president of the Taiwanese federation,
my teacher Master Chen, my whole team, my opponent’s team, everyone on
the mats looking at the videos. There were ﬁfteen minutes of mayhem,
bickering, po litics.
Interestingly, my opponent’s coach and his whole team considered the
ruling against me an outrage—they told me this afterward. By all accounts
my throw was legal. It was astonishing that hometown referees would do this
in the ﬁnal minute of a match for the world title. After a long dispute, the
judge s said this challenge would have to be resolved after the match. But for
now, I was down by one, the throw would not be counted, and there were 19
seconds left. I had to continue or I would lose by forfeit. Well, in those 19
seconds I gave it my all. I attacked him with everything I had, made the
situation totally chaotic and cranked into a throw that would have put him
down in training, but he gave up his body, literally. His elbow bent all the
way back; it was exploding inside, but he wouldn’t give up and stayed on his
feet until the bell rang. S uch heart!
Then I just sat down and watched chaos take over. Witnesses came from
all over who had seen the clock run out in round two when the judge  had
refused to allow the woman to ring the bell. There was a meeting held in the
center of the stadium with videos shown to the president of the Taiwanese Tai
Chi Federation, to the judge s, to everybody. My opponent’s coach, Chen Ze-
Cheng’s father, an honorable man, agreed with the president that this was
wrong. T hey sugge sted a shared championship. I went over to the head referee
and demanded a clear winner. Overtime. I knew I could take him. The
opposing coach agreed to a two-minute sudde n death playoff to decide the
World Championship. We would have international judge s. They went to
ﬁnd the Buffalo. For twenty minutes I paced the arena, red hot—if there is a
place beyond the zone, I was there. But it turned out that Buffalo’s elbow was
too severely injured. The ruling was a shared title in Moving Step. In a ﬂash,
it was over. No more battles to ﬁght. The martial fury subsided, and in its
place came pain, mellowness and camaraderie. Buffalo and I swayed on the
ﬁrst place podium together, huggi ng, a nd ho lding each other up.AFTERWORD
Two years after the madness of that World Championship in Taiwan, I am
still digesting the experience. Never in my life have I had to dig so deeply
into myself. Not even close. It was thrilling and also a bit alienating. I saw
parts of myself I didn’t know about. To survive and win, I became a gladiator,
pure and simple. I hadn’t fully understood that he was inside of me, waiting,
but surely all the work I had done for years had made him possible, perhaps
inevitable.
How did this new part of myself relate to the Josh I’d known my whole
life, the kid who was once scared of the dark, the chess player, the young man
who loves the rain and re-reading passages of Jack Kerouac? How did it ﬁt in
with my passion for Buddhi sm and the satyagraha of Mahatma Gandhi?
Honestly, these are questions that I am still sorting out. Do I want to explore
more of this side of myself? Maybe. But perhaps in a different guise. Mainly
what I felt after Taiwan was an urgent desire to get back to practice and shake
off the idea that I had climbed my mountain. In the last two years I have
started over. A new beginning. T here are great adventures ahead.
*  *  *
The writing off this book has spanned an intense and unlikely stretch of
years. As a kid growing up, in my tiny room I could never have dreamed that
such battles awaited me. While writing these pages, my ideas have evolved,
loves have fallen apart and come anew, world championships were lost and
won. If I have learned anything over my ﬁrst twenty-nine years, it is that we
cannot calculate our important contests, adventures, and great loves to the
end. The only thing we can really count on is getting surprised. No matter
how much preparation we do, in the real tests of our lives, we’ll be in
unfamiliar terrain. Conditions might not be calm or reasonable. It may feel as
though the whole world is stacked against us. This is when we have toperform better than we ever conceived of performing. I believe the key is to
have prepared in a manner that allows for inspiration, to have laid the
founda tion for us to create unde r the wildest pressures we ever imagined.
It is my hope that you, the reader, emerge from this book inspired and
perhaps a bit more enabled to follow your dreams in a manner that is
consistent with the unique gifts you bring to the table. That has been my
ambition. The ideas I’ve shared in these pages have worked for me and it’s my
hope that they sugge st a structure and direction. But there is no such thing as
a ﬁxed recipe for victory or happiness. If my approach feels right, take it,
hone it, give it your own ﬂavor. Leave my numbers behind. In the end,
mastery involves discovering the most resonant information and integrating
it so deeply and fully it disappears and allows us to ﬂy free.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
