To spend more time with the girl you really like, the key is to create a genuine, relaxed, and meaningful connection. According to the principles in "The Art of Learning," one effective approach is to establish a shared activity that promotes presence and mutual enjoyment. For example, the author emphasizes the power of routines that foster genuine connection. 

From the book:
> "First, we cultivate The Soft Zone, we sit with our emotions, observe them, work with them, learn how to let them float away if they are rocking our boat, and how to use them when they are fueling our creativity. Then we turn our weaknesses into strengths until there is no denial of our natural eruptions and nerves sharpen our game, fear alerts us, anger funs into focus."

Also:
> "The next step is the critical one: after he had fully internalized his routine, I suggested that he do it the morning before going to an important meeting. So Dennis transplanted his routine from playing catch with his son to a prelude to work. He did so and came back raving that he found himself in a totally serene state in what was normally a stressful environment. He had no trouble being fully present throughout the meeting."

Applying this idea: you can choose a relaxed, positive activity—like shared walks, casual conversation, or a simple game—that becomes a ritual for you to connect with her. The focus should be on being present, genuine, and comfortable in the moment. 

In summary:
- Find a shared activity that allows natural interaction and presence.
- Approach her with sincerity, focusing on genuine connection rather than pressure.
- Develop a routine that helps both of you feel relaxed and engaged, which can lead to more meaningful time together.

> "A heartfelt, empathetically present, incrementally inspiring mom or dad or coach can liberate an ambitious child to take the world by the horns. As adults, we have to take responsibility for ourselves and nurture a healthy, liberated mindset. We need to put ourselves out there, give it our all, and reap the lesson, win or lose."
