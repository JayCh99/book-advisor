It's wonderful that you recognize the value of being present and enjoying the moment. According to the principles in the book, embracing the "Soft Zone"—a state of quiet, resilient focus—allows you to be fully engaged in the here and now. When you are in this state, you flow with whatever happens, integrating life’s ripples into your creative and mental clarity.

Supporting quotes from the book include:
- "The Soft Zone is resilient, like a flexible blade of grass that can move with and survive hurricane-force winds."
- "When these principles of breathing merge with the movements of the Tai Chi form, practice becomes like the ebb and flow of water meeting a beach, the waves lapping against the sand (in-breath), then the water trickling back out to sea (gentle, full exhalation)."
- "If we have any hope of attaining excellence, we have to be prepared by a lifestyle of reinforcement. Presence must be like breathing."

This approach encourages you to cultivate that natural, calm, and centered awareness—accepting that feeling of emptiness as part of a peaceful, deeply grounded moment of being here now.
